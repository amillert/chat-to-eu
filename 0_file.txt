WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD O
AUDIOVISUAL MEDIA SERVICES The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, all interested parties, and especially providers of audiovisual media services
are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of audiovisual media services will no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences: 1.

general rule
be subject only to the law and the jurisdiction of their EU Member State of origin (as determined in the Directive), including when their programmes are received and/or re-transmitted in other EU Member States.
The Audiovisual Media Services Directive sets out specific rules for determining which EU Member State has jurisdiction over a media service provider in accordance with the Country-of-Origin principle. In particular, such providers shall be under the jurisdiction of the authorities of the Member State in which they are established on the basis of specific criteria laid down in the Directive
When these criteria are not applicable, subsidiary criteria are set out for media service providers broadcasting via satellite
In cases where none of the above criteria are applicable, the competent Member State shall be that in which the provider is established within the meaning of Article 49 to 55 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. As of the withdrawal date, audiovisual media services providers currently under the jurisdiction of United Kingdom authorities (for example because they are established in the United Kingdom within the meaning of the Directive
may fall under the jurisdiction of one of the EU-27 Member States if the criteria laid down in Article 2 of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive are fulfilled
Moreover, EU-27 Member States will be free to take whatever measures they will deem appropriate with regard to audiovisual media services coming from the United Kingdom as a third countr
and not satisfying the conditions laid down in Article 2 of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, provided they comply with Union law and the international obligations of the Union and, where applicable, within the limits of the European Convention on Transfrontier Television
(cf. recital 54 of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive)

OUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND
REEDOM OF TRANSMISSION/RECEPTION Under Article 3 o
the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, EU Member States shall ensure freedom of reception and shall not restrict retransmission on their territory of audiovisual media services from other Member States for reasons which fall within the fields coordinated by this Directive. As of the withdrawal date, audiovisual media services of United Kingdom media service providers received or retransmitted in the EU will no longer benefit from the freedom of reception and retransmission laid down in Article 3 of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. Therefore, EU-27 Member State
will be entitled, based on their own national law and, where applicable, within the limits of the European Convention on Transfrontier
As defined in the Audiovisual Media Services Directive.
Such criteria include, in particular, the location of the provider's head office, the place where editorial decisions about the audiovisual media service are taken, the place from where of the majority of the workforce involved in the service operates (cf. Article 2(3) of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive).
These criteria are: the Member State where the satellite uplink is situated or, in the absence of a satellite uplink in a Member State, the Member State to which the satellite capacity used by the provider appertains (cf. Article 2(4) of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive).
20 of the EU-27 Member States and the United Kingdom are parties to this Convention. The following EU Member States are not parties: Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Sweden (https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/132).

Under its Articles 13, 16 and 17, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive lays down specific rules for the promotion of distribution and production of European works, such as minimum quota reserved for European works. Article 1(1)(n) of the current Audiovisual Media Services Directive considers as European works originating in European third States party to the European Convention on Transfrontier Television of the Council of Europe and fulfilling the conditions of paragraph 3 of the above mentioned Article. Therefore, pursuant to the current version of the Directive and without prejudice to any change to the legal framework, works originating in United Kingdom are considered European works even after the withdrawal date for the purpose of fulfilling the quotas under Article 13, 16 and 17 of the Directive

, 2.3.2018, p. 1.
2 1.
USTOMERS From its date of application (3 December 2018), Regulation (EU) 2018/302 prohibits discrimination based on customers' nationality, place of residence or place of establishment, including unjustified geo-blocking, in certain cross-border transactions between a trader and a customer in relation to the sales of goods and the provision of services within the EU. In particular, it provides for the following measures protecting customers
ban of discriminatory blocking or limiting customers' access to traders' online interfaces (e.g. a website) and redirecting them to another online interface without the  prior consent (Article 3);  prohibition on traders to apply
in certain defined situations, on a discriminatory basis different conditions of access for customers to goods and services (Article 4; informally known as "shop like a local" principle)
non-discrimination for reasons related to payment (Article 5). As of the withdrawal date, natural persons residing in the United Kingdom (unless they have a nationality of a Member State) or undertakings established in the United Kingdom will not be able to benefit from Regulation (EU) 2018/302:
Firstly
such persons or undertakings wh
wish to access websites in the EU will not benefit from the aforementioned ban related to access to traders' online interfaces. This means that a trader could block, limit or redirect those customers to specific versions of his/her website which might be different from the one that the customers initially sought to access.   Secondly, such persons or undertakings will not have the guarantee to be able to "shop like a local" in the EU in the situations covered by Article 4 of the Regulation, including benefitting from the same prices and conditions relating to the delivery of goods and services as the locals (i.e. the customers of the trader's home Member State). For example, the off-line and on-line sales of goods and services, such as goods delivered or picked up in the EU territory, tickets for sports events or amusement parks in Member States, and the sale of electronically supplied services, such as hosting services, are areas where those customers will be affected.  Thirdly, such persons or undertakings using payment means from the United Kingdom will not be protected against traders applying different conditions for a payment transaction from the ones offered to EU customers
or refused to complete the purchase for reasons related to payment
when (wanting to
pay electronically for good
or service

Therefore,
s of the withdrawal date, traders who are established in the United Kingdom and offer their goods or services to customers in the EU will continue to be bound by the rules established by the Regulation (EU) 2018/302 in respect of those activities

On 11 April 2019, following a second request for an extension by the United Kingdom, the European Council also decided that the decision to extend until 31 October 2019 would cease to apply on 31 May 2019 if the United Kingdom had not held elections to the European Parliament and had not ratified the Withdrawal Agreement by 22 May 2019. As the United Kingdom had not ratified the Withdrawal Agreement by 22 May 2019, it held European elections on 23 May 2019.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
In addition, if the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified by both parties before that date, the withdrawal takes place on the first day of the month following the completion of the ratification procedures.

In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, persons concerned are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of copyright will no longer apply to the United Kingdom.  1.
HE MAIN INTERNATIONAL (MULTILATERAL
COPYRIGHT TREATIES WILL GOVERN THE EU
NITED KINGDOM RELATIONSHIP IN THE FIELD OF COPYRIGHT  The United Kingdom and the EU are contracting parties to many of the main international (multilateral) copyright treaties, such as the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty (WCT), the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT)
and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)


Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/
https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm

In accordance with the obligations under these agreements and in particular the principles of 'national treatment'  and 'most favoured nation' of nationals and legal persons that meet the criteria of eligibility for protection within the scope of the TRIP
Agreement, the international framework will govern
s of the withdrawal date:   the protection of copyright and related rights (e.g. exclusive rights of reproduction, distribution, rental, communication and making available for authors
and where applicable also to holders of related rights, such as phonogram producers, performers and broadcasting organisations);  the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights;  obligations concerning technological protection measures and rights management information
databases, except as set out below;  computer programs;  semiconductor topographies
enforcement of copyright (as one of the intellectual property rights in part
of TRIPS)
including border measures
It should be noted that the multilateral international agreements mentioned above do not provide for the same type or level of protection in relation to certain rights and where applicable exceptions or limitations to those rights as that set out today in the EU copyright acquis. In addition, the EU acquis provides for certain forms of lex specialis or particular cross-border measures for the benefit of rightholders or users in the internal market and/or the management of rights which have no counterpart in the international conventions.  Against this background, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom will have in particular the following consequences in the field of the copyright and related rights
2.
PECIFIC CONSEQUENCES IN THE FIELD OF COPYRIGHT  Broadcasters: Directive 93/83/EEC on the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission
provides inter alia that the act of communication to the public by satellite occurs solely in the Member State where the broadcast signals are introduced, thus localising the copyright relevant acts for the purpose of licensing. Consequently, in order to broadcast a work or other subject matter, broadcasters only have to clear rights in the Member State where the signal is introduced. As of the withdrawal date,
The United Kingdom is furthermore a party to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, which the EU is not. However, the EU is required pursuant to Article 1(4) WCT to apply Article 1-21 and the Appendix of the Berne Convention.
Council Directive 93/83/EEC of 27 September 1993 on the coordination of certain rules concerning        copyright and rights related to copyright applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission, OJ L 248, 6.10.1993, p. 15.
3 broadcasters in the United Kingdom will no longer benefit from the mechanism provided for by the Directive when providing cross-border satellite broadcasting services to EU customers and they will have to clear rights in all Member States where the signal reaches. Correspondingly, broadcasters in the EU will no longer be able to benefit from the mechanism provided for by the Directive when providing cross-border satellite broadcasting services to customers in the United Kingdom and they will have to secure clearance of the rights of all relevant rightholders if they wish to broadcast to the United Kingdom.  Collective Rights Management (online rights in musical works): Article 30 of Directive 2014/26/EU on collective management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online use in the internal market
provides for an obligation on a collective management organisation to represent another collective management organisation for multi-territorial licensing (for the online rights in musical works) in certain cases. As of the withdrawal date, EU collective management organisations will not be subject to the obligation to represent collective management organisations based in the United Kingdom for multi-territorial licensing in accordance with Article 30 of Directive 2014/26/EU and vice versa.  Orphan Works: Certain cultural institutions in the EU can benefit from a system of mutual recognition of orphan works in Directive 2012/28/EU on certain permitted uses of orphan works.
This system allows them to digitise and make a work available online in all Member States once it is recognised as an orphan work in one Member State.  As of the withdrawal date, the mechanism of mutual recognition provided for by Directive 2012/28/EU will no longer apply between the United Kingdom and the EU. Consequently, orphan works which have been recognised in the United Kingdom by the withdrawal date will no longer be recognised in the EU under Directive 2012/28/EU and the same will apply for orphan works recognised in the EU, as the system of mutual recognition under Directive 2012/28/EU will no longer be available in the United Kingdom
As a consequence, this means that the uses of orphan works from the United Kingdom allowed under the Directive, notably as regards making them available online, will no longer be allowed for cultural institutions in the EU and vice versa.
Access to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled: Directive (EU) 2017/1564 on certain permitted uses of certain works and other subject matter protected by copyright and related rights for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled10

Directive (EU) 2017/1564 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 September 2017 on certain permitted uses of certain works and other subject matter protected by copyright and related rights for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled, OJ L 242, 20.9.2017, p. 6. This Directive must be transposed by 11 October 2018.
4 introduces a mandatory exception for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled and authorised entities operating on behalf of these persons. The Directive furthermore provides that such authorised entities may rely on the exception for a beneficiary person or another authorised entity in other Member States and that beneficiary person
and authorised entities may have access to accessible format copies from an authorised entity established in any Member State.  As of the withdrawal date, persons in the United Kingdom will no longer be able to obtain accessible format copies from authorised entities in the EU under the framework provided for by Directive (EU) 2017/1564. Conversely, authorised entities and beneficiary persons in the EU will not be able to obtain accessible format copies from authorised entities in the United Kingdom either. The exchange of accessible format copies between the EU and third countries that have ratified the Marrakesh Treaty11 is governed by Regulation (EU) 2017/156312 on the cross-border exchange between the EU and third countries of accessible format copies of certain works and other subject matter protected by copyright and related rights for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR COMPETITION
Brussels, 25 March 2019
OTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU COMPETITION LAW The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union . On 22 March 2019, the European Council (Article 50) decided, in agreement with the United Kingdom, and in the event that the Withdrawal Agreement is approved by the House of Commons by 29 March 2019, to extend the 2-years period provided for in Article 50(3) TEU until 22 May 2019.  In the event that the Withdrawal Agreement is not approved by the House of Commons by 29 March 2019, the European Council decided to extend the period provided for in Article 50(3) TEU until 12 April 2019. This means that as from 13 April 2019, 00:00h
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the uncertainties surrounding the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, all interested parties, and especially economic operators, are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Subject to the transition period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement,
as of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom will become a third country as regards the application of EU competition rules3.  This notice provides some guidance only on the main implications that can be foreseen in a no deal scenario for the application of EU competition law (antitrust, merger control).4
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
Cf. Part four of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (OJ, C 66 I, 19.2.2019, p. 1

Until the United Kingdom withdraws, however, EU competition law remains fully applicable in the United Kingdom, as in any other Member State.
This is an informal document of the services of DG Competition and it does not create or affect legal rights nor does it bind the European Commission.
2 1. EU ANTITRUST ENFORCEMEN
EU antitrust enforcement is governed by Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Regulation (EC) No 1/2003,
and Regulation (EC) No 773/2004.
This legal framework is complemented by other Regulations dealing with particular types of conduct or with specific sectors, as well as the guidance provided in various decisions,
notices and guidelines adopted by Courts.
Territorial application of EU competition law The territorial application of EU antitrust rules is defined in Articles 101 and 102 ts country of incorporation or where its headquarters are located, and may also cover conduct occurring outside of the EU. The Court of Justice has held that the fact that an undertaking participating in an agreement is situated in a third country does not prevent the application of the TFEU, if that agreement is operative on the territory of the internal market9. For conduct occurring outside the EU, the Commission's jurisdiction can be justified under public international law either on the basis of the implementation of conduct in the EU10 or on the basis of the qualified effects doctrine in the EU.11
Hence, the fact that the United Kingdom will become a third country following its withdrawal, will not have as such an impact on the applicability of the EU antitrust rules to UK companies. As any other company registered or headquartered in a third country, a UK company will be subject to EU antitrust rules if its anticompetitive conduct is implemented or produces effects in the EU. This applies to public undertakings and undertakings enjoying special or exclusive rights located or established in the United Kingdom.

3 Specific issues in the enforcement of EU antitrust rules following the United Kingdom's withdrawal The Commission will continue to exercise its jurisdiction on agreements or conduct affecting competition within the internal market. The jurisdiction of the United Kingdom over such practices pursuant to its own national antitrust rules may also be applicable in parallel.  Consequence on the Commission's investigative powers and validity of Commission decisions The Commission will no longer be able to carry out inspections under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 in the United Kingdom. The Commission will still be able to obtain information under Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003.   All Commission decisions adopted under Articles 101 and 102 TFEU before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU will remain valid.  2. EU MERGER CONTROL
EU merger control is governed by the EU Merger Regulation 12 and its Implementing Regulation.13 This legal framework is complemented by guidance case law.14 The EUMR establishes an ex ante control system, in which certain types of transactions with specific turnover thresholds have to obtain the Commission's approval before the parties involved are allowed to implement them. If the Commission has jurisdiction over a transaction under the EUMR, Member States are no longer allowed to apply their national competition laws to this transaction. They may, however, take appropriate measures to protect legitimate interests other than those taken into consideration by the EUMR, under the conditions provided for in Article 21 thereof.  The exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission in the EU under the EUMR is also referred to as the "one-stop-shop principle". As for antitrust rules, the EU merger control system applies regardless of the nationality or country of incorporation or where the headquarters of a company are located. Hence, the fact that the United Kingdom will become a third country following its withdrawal from the EU, will not have an impact on the applicability of the EUMR to UK companies when the jurisdictional criteria of the EUMR are fulfilled.                                                   12
Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings, OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1.  13
Commission Regulation (EC) No 802/2004 of 21 April 2004 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings and its annexes (Form CO, Short Form CO, Form RS and Form RM) (OJ L 133, 30.4.2004, p. 1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1033/2008 (OJ L 279, 22.10.2008, p. 3
and by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1269/2013
OJ
336, 14.12.2013, p. 1
14
For an overview of the various notices and guidelines, see
http://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/legislation/legislation.html

It is possible that both the Commission and the UK national competition authority will be competent to review in parallel a planned concentration but under their respective substantive and jurisdictional rules on merger control.15 Therefore, companies will no longer benefit from the one-stop-shop principle in that regard. Specific issues concerning the assessment of the Commission's jurisdiction  The relevant date for establishing EU jurisdiction over a concentration pursuant to Articles 1 and 3 EUMR is the date of the conclusion of the binding legal agreement, the announcement of a public bid or the acquisition of a controlling interest or the date of the first merger notification, whichever date is earlier16. These rules are not altered by the United Kingdom's departure from the EU. If any of the relevant events takes place prior to the United Kingdom's withdrawal, the Commission will assess whether the jurisdictional test of the EUMR is met on the date of that event.
If the relevant date for establishing EU jurisdiction takes place after the United Kingdom's withdrawal, the Commission will no longer take into account the turnover that the parties to the concentration realise in the United Kingdom, when establishing the relevant EU-wide turnover and the relevant turnover realised in individual Member States.17
Specific jurisdictional issues over concentrations without EU dimension following a referral As regards the Commission's jurisdiction following a referral of a concentration without EU dimension, a distinction needs to be drawn between pre-notification referrals pursuant to Article 4(5) EUMR, and post-notification referrals pursuant to Article 22 EUMR.
Pre-notification referrals pursuant to Article 4(5) EUMR Under Article 4(5) EUMR the notifying party or parties may make a reasoned submission that a concentration without a Union dimension be reviewed by the Commission, provided that the concentration is capable of being reviewed under the national competition laws of at least three Member States. Any competent Member State may object within 15 working days. In instances where an Article 4(5) submission has been made prior to the withdrawal date and where a concentration without Union dimension is capable of being reviewed in three Member States, amongst which the United Kingdom, the Commission will acquire jurisdiction under Article 4(5) EUMR if, prior to the United Kingdom's withdrawal, the period                                                  15
As is the case now for transactions which are reviewed by the Commission and third-country competition agencies. 16
See paragraph 156 of the Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice under Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings, OJ C95 of 16.4.2008, p. 1
17
This may result in some transactions that would have met the EUMR thresholds, if the UK turnover of the undertakings concerned were to be included, not being notifiable; for example where the target undertaking does not realise a turnover of at least EUR 250 million in the EU without counting its turnover in the United Kingdom.
5 of 15 working days has elapsed without any competent Member State expressing its disagreement.
The fact that a concentration is capable of being reviewed in the United Kingdom will no longer be relevant for the application of Article 4(5) EUMR for submissions made after its withdrawal.
Post-notification referrals pursuant to Article 22 EUMR After its withdrawal, the United Kingdom will no longer be empowered to refer cases to the Commission or to join referral requests by other Member States under Article 22 EUMR. If the United Kingdom has requested the referral or joined a referral request by another Member State prior to its withdrawal and the Commission has decided (or is deemed to have decided) to examine the concentration in accordance with Article 22(3) EUMR before the withdrawal date, the case will be considered to be referred also with respect to the United Kingdom. If not, the case will not be considered to be referred in relation to the United Kingdom. Substantive assessment As from the withdrawal date and if the Withdrawal Agreement is not ratified, the Commission will have to take account of the fact that the United Kingdom will no longer be part of the internal market. This implies that the Commission will no longer be competent to find that a planned concentration would (or would not) significantly impede effective competition in UK national or subnational markets. Moreover, trade between the EU and the United Kingdom may become subject to new tariffs and non-tariff barriers. This competitive assessment including the suitability and viability of remedies where a concentration leads to competition concerns. The respective consequences will have to be assessed individually for each case concerned and merging parties are invited -General for Competition. Inspections pursuant to Article 13 EUMR will no longer be possible in the United Kingdom. The Commission will still be able to obtain information under Article 11 EUMR. Continued validity of Commission decisions under the EUMR after the United  All Commission decisions under the EUMR (including decisions imposing conditions and obligations) remain valid after the United Kingdom's withdrawal. For the sake of clarity, no distinction should be drawn between decisions that relate to the effect of a concentration on competition at the level of the European Economic Area or within any of the remaining 27 EU Member States, and Commission decisions that relate to the effect of a concentration in UK national or sub-national markets. The decision will in principle remain valid also in instances
where commitments address a competition issue only affecting a UK national or sub-national market.18   Following the United Kingdom's withdrawal, parties may in certain circumstances consider requesting the Commission to waive, modify or substitute certain commitments under the standard review clause that is typically contained in commitments.19 Requests may be considered founded in instances where the commitments in question address competition issues in UK markets only (or markets including only the United Kingdom and a third country). The services of the Commission's Directorate-General for Competition will be available for guidance in individual cases.

Indeed, at the time of taking the decision, the Commission had jurisdiction and therefore the obligation to seek a remedy to address a competition concerns in the United Kingdom, while the UK national competition authority did not have jurisdiction to do so, remains in place.  19

NOTICE TO STAKEHOLDERS
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES ON EUROPEAN WORKS COUNCILS
he United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that as from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date')1, the United Kingdom will be a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the uncertainties surrounding the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement
all interested parties, and especially economic operators
are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to the transition period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement,
as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of information and consultation of workers at transnational level, in particular Directive 2009/38/EC on European Works Councils
will no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences


n accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.

HRESHOLDS FOR APPLYING DIRECTIVE 2009/38/EC Directive 2009/38/EC sets out the conditions for setting up European Works Councils as well as their functioning and potential dissolution. In particular, Article
of Directive 2009/38/EC -000 employees within the Member States and at least 150 employees in each of at least mmunity-undertakings with the following characteristics:   at least 1 000 employees within the Member States,  at least two group undertakings in different Member States, and  at least one group undertaking with at least 150 employees in one Member State and at least one other group undertaking with at least 150 employees in another Member State As of the withdrawal date, for the purpose of determining whether there is a Community-scale undertaking or a Community-scale group of undertakings to which Directive 2009/38/EC applies, the United Kingdom will no longer be counted as a Member State and employees in the United Kingdom will no longer count as employees within the Member States.
As a consequence, should the relevant thresholds no longer be met due to the United longer be subject to the rights and obligations stemming from the application of Directive 2009/38/EC. That works council may continue to function under the relevant national law, but not as a European Works Council within the meaning of Directive 2009/38/EC. Since Directive 2009/38/EC allows for the participation of representatives from third countries in European Works Councils6, representatives from the United Kingdom will be able to take part in European Works Councils, where the relevant agreement referred to in Article 6 of  Directive 2009/38/EC so provides.  The withdrawal of the United Kingdom may also impact
he duty on the part of the central management to initiate negotiations for the establishment of a European Works Council or an information and consultation procedure which presupposes a written request of at least 100 employees or their representatives in at least two undertakings or establishments in at least two different Member States (Article 5(1) of Directive 2009/38/EC).  2.

For such European Works Councils, unless they designate a new representative agent in a Member State, this role will be assumed by the establishment or group undertaking employing the greatest number of pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive 2009/38/EC. This responsibility is transferred automatically and immediately as of the withdrawal date. 3.
PPLICABLE LAW TO THE AGREEMENT REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE
OF DIRECTIVE 2009/38/EC The law applicable to the agreement referred to in Article 6 of Directive 2009/38/EC is that  Where the law of the United Kingdom has applied to an existing European Works Council, as of the withdrawal date the law of a remaining Member State will apply automatically and immediately to ensure that the rights of employees under Directive 2009/38/EC remain enforceable within the Union.  While it is thus not necessary from a legal point of view to amend agreements referring to the legislation of the United Kingdom to remain in conformity with Directive 2009/38/EC, it is highly recommended to amend such agreements and stipulate explicitly the law of a Member State for the sake of clarity and legal certainty (see below, section 5 of this notice). 4.

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES ON THE PROVISION OF SERVICES AND POSTING OF WORKERS The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Following
request by the United Kingdom, the European Council (Article 50) agreed on 11 April 2019
to extend further
the period provided for in Article 50(3) TEU until 31 October 2019.

Moreover, according to the first paragraph of Article 54 TFEU, legal persons established in the EU-27 owned by UK nationals and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business in the EU-27 will benefit from the freedom to provide services in the EU-27. 2.
OSTING OF WORKERS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PROVISION OF SERVICE
Directive 96/71/EC provides for a legal framework that applies to undertakings established in an EU Member State
which post workers to another EU Member State. As of the withdrawal date
Directive 96/71/EC no longer applies to
EU-27 undertakings posting workers to the United Kingdom; and
UK undertakings posting workers to the EU-27. Rather, in these cases, as of the withdrawal date the following applies:
national law of the EU-27 Member State
taking into account also the commitments and qualifications made by the EU and the UK in the framework of the GATS in relation to the temporary presence of certain categories of natural persons in the EU-27 to supply services;15
13
The second paragraph of Article 56 TFEU provides the possibility for the European Parliament and the Council ry who provide services and who are established within the Union. However, this possibility has not been used so far. 14
The commitments and qualifications
are accessible here: https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/serv_e/serv_commitments_e.htm
15
The commitments and qualifications are accessible here: https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/serv_e/serv_commitments_e.htm

- Article 1(4) of Directive 96/71/EC, which provides that Member States must not give more favourable treatment to undertakings established in a third country than to undertakings established in the EU
As of the withdrawal date, Member States must therefore ensure that territory by undertakings established in the United Kingdom are granted at least the terms and conditions of employment applicable to workers posted to that Member State by an undertaking established in the EU
- As regards the specific case of intra-corporate transfers, Directive 2014/66/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals in the framework of an intra-corporate transfer16 will become relevant for UK companies: The Directive harmonizes the conditions for entry, stay and intra-EU mobility of third-country national workers being posted by a group of undertakings based outside the EU to an entity of the same group based on the EU territory. The Directive covers stays of up to 3 years for managers and specialists and up to 1 year for trainees
Directive 96/71/EC continues to apply in the event that an EU-27 company posts a UK national who is legally residing and working in an EU-27 Member State to another EU-27 Member State, without prejudice to national laws relating to the entry, residence and access to employment of third-country workers to the extent that these laws comply with EU law.17 According to the Vander Elst case-law of the CJEU,18 it constitutes a restriction of the freedom to provide services by a Member State (host country) to make third-country workers who are regularly and habitually employed by a service provider established in another Member State and who are posted to the first Member State subject to administrative formalities, such as the obligation to obtain a work permit. Such a restriction complies with the freedom to provide services only if it is justified on the basis of a legitimate public interest and proportionate.

OTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE EURATOM ACQUIS The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties
In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement and related repercussions, stakeholders engaged in the nuclear field are reminded of legal repercussion
which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country

Subject to any transitional arrangement that may form part of a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the overall set of Euratom provisions (i.e. the Euratom acquis
no longer applies to the United Kingdom. This has
in particular
the following consequences

Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.

For certain Euratom-related matters, the EU is trying to agree solutions with the United Kingdom in the withdrawal agreement. The essential principles of the EU/Euratom's position on nuclear materials and safeguard equipment (Euratom
are available here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/position-paper-nuclear-materials-and-safeguard-equipmen
euratom_en.
This notice does not address rules based on the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)
6   Although not being Euratom acquis, it is recalled that nuclear materials, facilities, technologies and equipment fall within the scope of Council Regulation No 428/2009, of 5 May 2009, setting up a
1.
OMMON SUPPLY POLICY Chapter 6 of the Euratom Treaty provides that the supply of ores, source materials and special fissile materials be ensured by means of a common supply policy on the principle of equal access to sources of supply. To this end the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) has the exclusive right to conclude contracts relating to the supply (imports, exports, and supply within the Community) of ores, source materials and special fissile materials. The statutes of ESA provide that this exclusive right is exercised by the co-signature of ESA to all contracts between parties for relevant material. In specific cases a separate authorisation may be required from the Commission before the ESA co-signs the contract.  As from the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom will cease to participate in the
ommon supply policy. Consequently, as from the withdrawal date, the co-signature by ESA of contracts pertaining to the supply of nuclear material
(and, where applicable, the Commission authorisation for such contracts) in connection with the United Kingdom
will cease to have effect.  As from the withdrawal date, ESA and, where relevant, the Commission, will have to take account of the fact that materials transferred to the United Kingdom will no longer contribute to the Community's security of supply and reach an assessment of the United Kingdom's safeguards regime before its co-signature and, where relevant, authorisation can be given in relation to the aforementioned contracts
This is without prejudice to the other elements of the contracts which are a matter for the parties to assess.  2.
XPORTS 2.1. Authorisation to dispose production outside the Community In accordance with Article 59 of the Euratom Treaty
the "conclusion" (co-signature by ESA) of contracts pertaining to the export of EU-produced nuclear materials towards a third country need
to be authorised by the Commission. Such authorisation may not be granted if the recipients of the supplies fail to satisfy the requirement that the general interests of the Community are safeguarded or in the event the terms and conditions of the contracts in question are contrary to the Euratom Treaty
Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items. For more details, see the "Notice to stakeholders
Withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in the field of import/export licences for certain goods
(https://ec.europa.eu/info/brexit/brexit-preparedness_en

The Commission authorisation will not be granted if the export of EU-produced nuclear materials towards a third country risks to jeopardise the security of supply, in the medium term, of such materials for EU users, or if the contracts concerned are likely to put at risk the EU nuclear non-proliferation objective.
As from the withdrawal date, this requirement will apply to exports from the EU-27 to the United Kingdom. 2.2. Consent of third parties and other special procedures Euratom has concluded several Nuclear Cooperation Agreements
with third countries. Currently, under these agreements nuclear items (including nuclear materials, equipment and other items usually foreseen in such agreements
can be transferred within the nuclear common market on the territory of the Euratom Community (including to and from UK) without being submitted to a special procedure
and/or the prior consent of the Third Country concerned.  As of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom will be neither part of the common nuclear market, nor will it be covered by these agreements. As a consequence, exports and imports of nuclear items, to and from the United Kingdom
may require a special procedure and/or the prior consent of the Third Country concerned
3.
ASIC SAFETY STANDARDS DIRECTIVE10 Council Directive 2013/59
uratom11  the Euratom Basic Safety Standards Directive  applies, inter alia, to the import to and export from the Community of radioactive material (see Article 2(2) a of Council Directive 2013/59

This means for instance that the Supplier State would have to obtain formal governmental assurances from the Recipient State with regard to the peaceful uses of these items and in line with the provisions of the Nuclear Suppliers Group Guidelines for Nuclear Transfers (INFCIRC 254, as revised). 10
For goods (including goods falling within the scope of the Euratom acquis
placed on the EU market before the withdrawal date, the EU is trying to agree solutions with the United Kingdom in the withdrawal agreement. The essential principles of the EU's position on goods placed on the market under Union law before the withdrawal date are available here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/position-paper-goods-placed-market-under-union-law-withdrawal-date_en
Please note that the essential principles of the EU's position on goods build on one single definition of "placing on the market" ("first making available on the market"). 11   Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom laying down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation, OJ L 13, 17.01.2014, p.1.
radioactive material from the Community to the United Kingdom will need to comply with the requirements in this Directive. In particular:   Article 20 of Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom defines specific requirements on undertakings intending to import a consumer product; Article 21 lists products for which import and export are prohibited. In addition, the import of consumer products from third countries is subject to regulatory control and requires notification and licensing (Articles 25 and 28).   Article 75 of Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom contains specific provisions on building materials which need to be complied with before such materials can be placed on the market in the Community.12  Article 93 of Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom obliges Member States to encourage the establishment of systems to detect the presence of radioactive contamination in metal products imported from third countries. 4.
UTHORISATION/INFORMATION OF SHIPMENTS13 As of the withdrawal date, Council Regulation (Euratom) No 1493/93 on shipments of radioactive substances between Member States14 will cease to apply to shipments between an EU-27 Member State and the United Kingdom. Council Directive 2006/117/Euratom on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste15 and spent fuel lays down a Community system of supervision and control of transboundary shipments of radioactive waste and spent fuel. As of the withdrawal date the provisions of Chapter 2 of this Directive on intra-Community shipments will cease to apply to shipments between a Member State and the United Kingdom and Chapter 3 of the Directive on Extra Community Shipments will apply to shipments related to the United Kingdom.                                                  12
"Building materials" under Council Directive 2013/59 are "construction products
as defined in Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products. Articles 13 and 2(21) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 lay down specific procedural obligations on importers that have to be fulfilled when placing a construction product from a third country on the Union market. Consequently, when placing on the market building materials imported from the UK, the importers will have to demonstrate the compliance with Article 75 of Directive 2013/59 by following the imports-specific procedure defined in Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011, (cf. recitals 17  21 of Directive 2013/59). 13
For a movement of goods that has started before and ends on or after the withdrawal date, ("sailing goods"), the EU is trying to agree solutions with the United Kingdom in the withdrawal agreement.

Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 also provides for common requirements for the designation of nominated electricity market operators (NEMOs) in market coupling. Their tasks include receiving orders from market participants, having overall responsibility for matching and allocating orders in accordance with the single day-ahead and intraday coupling results, publishing prices and settling and clearing the contracts resulting from the trades according to relevant participant agreements and regulations. NEMOs are entitled to offer their services in Member States other than those in which they are designated. As of the withdrawal date
United Kingdom based operators will cease to participate in the single allocation platform for forward interconnection capacity, the European balancing platforms and the single day-ahead and intraday coupling. United Kingdom based NEMOs will become third country operators and will no longer be entitled to carry out market coupling services in the EU.

ELECTRICITY AND GAS TRADING Regulation (EU) 1227/201111 prohibits market abuses on EU wholesale power and gas markets. In order to effectively prosecute market abuses
Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 1227/2011 requires EU based market participants to register with their national energy regulatory authority. Market participants from third countries are required to register with the national energy regulatory authority of a Member State where they are active. As of the withdrawal date
market participants based in the United Kingdom will become third country participants. As a consequence, according to Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 1227/2011, participants based in the United Kingdom who wish to continue trading EU wholesale energy products as of the withdrawal date will need to register with the national energy regulatory authority of a Member State where they are active. According to Article 9(4) of Regulation (EU) 1227/2011, the registration form has to be submitted prior to entering into a transaction which is required to be reported.  The national regulatory authority registering market participants from the United Kingdom is responsible for ensuring that the enforcement provisions pursuant to Article 13 to 18 of Regulation (EU) 1227/2011 can be effectively applied.

require Member State
and the Commission to assess whether granting certification to the concerned transmission system operator controlled by (a) third country person(s) will put at risk the security of energy supply of the Member State and the EU.  TSOs controlled on the withdrawal date by investors from the United Kingdom are TSOs controlled by persons from a third country. For these TSOs to continue their activity in the EU, they require a certification in accordance with Article 11 of Directive (EU) 2009/72/EC and Directive (EU) 2009/73/EC. Member States may refuse certification where granting certification poses a threat to security of supply of the Member State.

It ensures inter alia that procedures are open to all entities and authorisations should be granted on the basis of objective and published criteria. According to the second sub-paragraph of Article 2(2) of Directive (EU) 94/22/EC, Member States may refuse on grounds of national security to allow access to and exercise of these activities to any entity which is effectively controlled by third countries or third country nationals.  As of the withdrawal date, the second sub-paragraph of Article 2(2) of Directive (EU) 94/22/EC applies where authorisations have been granted or are requested to be granted to an entity which is effectively controlled by the United Kingdom or United Kingdom nationals.

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF GUARANTEES OF ORIGIN OF ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that, unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, all stakeholders concerned
are reminded of certain legal repercussions stemming from currently applicable rules of Union law which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources
and Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency
will no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences in the areas of Guarantees of Origin and Certification of Installers.
Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.

Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, EU waste law no longer applies to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences with regard to shipments of waste

Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
1.
RANSBOUNDARY SHIPMENTS OF WASTE
1.1. Prohibitions of waste shipments Articles 34 and 3(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 on shipments of waste
prohibit the export of   waste for disposal; and   mixed municipal waste
for recovery operations  from the EU to a third country, unless it is a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and a party to the Basel Convention. Consequently, as of the withdrawal date all exports of waste for disposal and the export of mixed municipal waste for recovery from the EU-27 to the United Kingdom will be prohibited. Imports of waste into the EU-27 will be governed, as of the withdrawal date, by Title V of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006, whereby imports of waste from a third country party to the Basel Convention remains allowed, subject to the requirements set out in that Regulation.
1.2.
onsents issued prior to the withdrawal date Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 requires the "consent" by the competent authorities of destination, dispatch and transit of notified waste shipments. For consents issued by competent authorities of Member States of the EU-27
ior to the withdrawal date for shipments as of the withdrawal date, the following applies:  Where the shipment is prohibited under Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006, the consent becomes void.
In the context of the negotiations of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement, the EU is trying to agree solutions with the United Kingdom for movement
of goods that have started before and end after the end of the transition period ("sailing goods"). See, in particular, the latest text of the draft withdrawal agreement agreed at negotiator's level, which is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_agreement_coloured.pdf and the "joint statement" from the negotiators of the EU and of the United Kingdom Government presented on 19 June 2018 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/brexit-negotiations/negotiating-documents-article-50-negotiations-united-kingdom_en).

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF CHEMICALS REGULATION UNDER REACH The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that as from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET)
the United Kingdom will be a third country
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the uncertainties surrounding the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, all interested parties, and especially economic operators, are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to the transition period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement,
as of the withdrawal date, Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH
and establishing a European Chemicals Agency,
will no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences:

n accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.

OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p. 1
2 1.
EGISTRATION 1.1. Registrations held by a registrant (manufacturer/producer, importer or Only Representative) established in the United Kingdom According to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, as a general rule, substances on their own, in mixtures or in article
manufactured or placed on the EU market in quantities of 1 tonne or more per year have to be registered with the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The registrant has to be established in the EU (Article 3(4), (9) and (11) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006). Where a manufacturer/producer is established in a third country, that manufacturer/producer may appoint a person acting as his rticle 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006). The Only Representative has to comply with the requirements set out in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, in particular as regards the keeping available of information with regard to quantities and supply of the registered substances. As of the withdrawal date, a registration held by a registrant (manufacturer/producer, importer or Only Representative) established in the United Kingdom is no longer valid in the EU
Therefore, manufacturers/producers established in the United Kingdom should
transfer the registration to a manufacturer or importer in the EU-27; or  appoint an Only Representative in the EU-27 as registrant for the substance. ECHA has published detailed guidance on how to transfer a registration prior to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom.
Manufacturers/producers established in a third country and using an Only Representative established in the United Kingdom should transfer the registration to an Only Representative in the EU-27. Importers established in the United Kingdom and supplying substances, mixtures or articles to the EU-27 should take steps to ensure that the manufacturer/producer in the third country from which they are importing appoint an Only Representative in the EU-27 as registrant for the substance. 1.2. Relevance for downstream users in the EU-27 According to Article
of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, a downstream user may only use a substance or mixture in quantities of 1 tonne or more per year that has been registered in accordance with that Regulation

https://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13552/how_to_transfer_uk_reach_registrations_en.pdf/1fb443ce-79de-6596-aae5-3f1033f1a5fb
Moreover, as of the withdrawal date, a substance not registered  in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 can no longer be imported into the EU-27 in quantities of 1 tonne or more per year
Therefore, downstream users should assess whether the substance used is registered by a registrant established in the EU-27. Where this is not the case, the downstream user should

dapt the supply chain accordingly (i.e. identify an alternative supplier)

ontact the registrant to ensure that the registrant plans to appoint an Only Representative; or
egister the substance in the capacity of importer or Only Representative appointed by the UK registrant. ECHA has published a list of all substances solely registered by legal entities established in the United Kingdom.
1.3. Joint submissions/lead registrant Article
11 and 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 require the joint submission of a registration, with a Lead Registrant.  As set out in section 1.1 of this notice, as of the withdrawal date, the registration by a person established in the United Kingdom becomes invalid. If this person was the Lead Registrant
the steps set out above (section 1.1.) should be taken. If that Lead Registrant does not intend to take these steps
one of the other members of the joint submissions should take over the role of the Lead Registrant. 2.
UTHORISATION 2.1. Authorisation holders and authorisation applicants established in the United Kingdom According to Article 56(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the use and placing on the market of substances listed in Annex XIV to that Regulation require an authorisation by the Commission to be placed on the market or used
According to Article 62(2) in conjunction with Article 3(9)
(11) and (13) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the applicant for an authorisation and the authorisation holder have to be established in the EU. As of the withdrawal date, an application for an authorisation submitted by
or an authorisation held by a person established in the United Kingdom is no longer valid in the EU

https://echa.europa.eu/advice-to-companies
4 Where the application for authorisation or authorisation decision covers uses by actors downstream in accordance with Article 56(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the end of validity of the application/authorisation will also affect those operators established in the EU-27 who will no longer be covered by the application/authorisation.  There are no adopted authorisation decisions falling under this scenario. Regarding pending authorisation applications falling under this scenario, in order to ensure that the downstream users are covered by the application, the UK-based applicant should ensure that
the application is transferred before the withdrawal date to a legal entity established in the EU-27. Such a transfer must be the result of a change of legal entity (for example, as the result of a merger, a split or an asset sale), and the person to whom the application is transferred must qualif
as manufacturer, importer or downstream user of the substances within the scope of the application for authorisation; or  the application is transferred to an Only Representative established in the  EU-27 with effect o
the withdrawal date. The applicant has to notify ECHA of the legal entity change before the withdrawal date. 2.2.
Relevance for downstream users in the EU-27 According to Article 56(2
of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the authorisation may encompass the downstream use of a substance. Therefore, downstream users subject to authorisation should assess whether the applicant for authorisation covering their use is established in the United Kingdom. In this case, the downstream user should contact the applicant for authorisation in order to ensure that the latter takes the steps set out under section 2.1 of this notice
Alternatively, where the application for other EU-27 legal entities, the downstream user may get the substance supplied  from an EU-based co-applicant.
The -website of ECHA (https://echa.europa.eu/uk-withdrawal-from-the-eu) as well as the Commission website on Chemicals (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/reach/reach_en.htm) provide additional information. These pages will be updated with further information, where necessary.

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF STATUTORY AUDIT The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that, unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date')
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, statutory auditors and companies subject to audit requirements are reminded of legal repercussions which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country.
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of statutory audit (in particular the Statutory Audit Directive5) no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences:
Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.

NTITLEMENT TO CARRY OUT STATUTORY AUDITS IN THE EU  As of the withdrawal date, natural persons approved as auditors by the United Kingdom (United Kingdom auditors) will be considered third country auditors and they will no longer be considered statutory auditors for the purpose of the Statutory Audit Directive.
Audit entities approved by the United Kingdom (United Kingdom audit entities) will be considered third country audit entities and will no longer be considered audit firms for the purpose of the Statutory Audit Directive. Neither United Kingdom auditors nor United Kingdom audit entities will be entitled to carry out statutory audits required by the law of a Member State in accordance with the Statutory Audit Directive.  An audit firm approved in a Member State (EU-27) should carefully examine whether it will continue, as of the withdrawal date, complying with the conditions set out in Article 3(4) of the Statutory Audit Directive, in particular in relation to voting rights and members of the administrative or management body of the audit firm
2.
EGISTRATION OF THIRD-COUNTRY AUDITORS AND AUDIT ENTITIES  As of the withdrawal date, a United Kingdom auditor or United Kingdom audit entity providing an audit report concerning the annual or consolidated accounts of a company incorporated outside the EU whose transferable securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market
of an EU Member State will have to be registered in that Member State as third country auditor or third country audit firm8, in accordance with Article 45 of the Statutory Audit Directive.   Failing such registration, any such audit report will have no legal effect in the Member State concerned.  United Kingdom auditors or United Kingdom audit entities registered in accordance with Article 45 of the Statutory Audit Directive will in principle be subject to the systems of public oversight, quality assurance and investigation and penalties of the Member State of registration (cf. Article 45(3) of the Statutory Audit Directive).

Article 16(2) and 17(2) of the Statutory Audit Directive.
Without prejudice to derogation in the case of equivalence (cf. Article 46 of the Statutory Audit Directive).
3 statutory auditor or audit firm approved in a Member State acting as group auditor of an undertaking in the EU will need to take into account, in respect of the audit of that undertaking's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, that the relevant United Kingdom auditor or United Kingdom audit entity will be considered as third-country auditor or third-country audit entity for the purpose of the requirements of that Article (e.g. the audit work of the United Kingdom auditor or United Kingdom audit entity will be subject to evaluation and review by the group auditor).  Cooperation of EU statutory auditors and audit firms with competent authorities of the United Kingdom: In accordance with Article 23(5), second subparagraph (on confidentiality and professional secrecy) of the Statutory Audit Directive, the statutory auditor or audit firm approved in a Member State that carries out the statutory audit of an undertaking in the EU which forms part of a group of undertakings whose parent undertaking is in the United Kingdom or of an undertaking in the EU which has issued securities in the United Kingdom may only transfer audit working papers or other documents related to the audit of the audited undertaking in the EU to the competent authorities of the United Kingdom under the conditions set out in Article 47 of the Statutory Audit Directive. In particular, this requires the agreement of the Member State concerned and the existence of reciprocity arrangements between the competent authorities.

Use of ratings for regulatory purposes. As a consequence of UK established redit institutions, investment firms, insurance undertakings, reinsurance undertakings, institutions for occupational retirement provision, management companies, investment companies, alternative investment fund managers and central counterparties in the EU-27 will no longer be able to use ratings issued by these CRAs for regulatory purposes (e.g. Solvency II for insurance undertaking, Capital Requirements Regulation for credit institutions).
Endorsement. Ratings issued by a CRA established in a third country which is part of a group to which a CRA established in the EU and registered by ESMA belongs can be "endorsed" provided that certain conditions are met in accordance with Article 4(3) CRA Regulation, e.g. the conduct of the credit ratings activities by CRA established in a third country fulfils requirements which are at least as stringent as the EU specific framework, there is an objective reason for the rating to be elaborated in the third country and there is an appropriate cooperation arrangement between ESMA and the relevant supervisory authority. When "endorsed", ratings may be used for regulatory purposes.
Prospectus. In accordance with Article 4(1) of the CRA Regulation where a prospectus contains a reference to a credit rating or credit ratings issued by a CRA established in the United Kingdom, it will need to include clear and prominent information stating that those credit ratings are not issued by a credit rating agency established in the EU and registered under the CRA Regulation.

Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, stakeholders, including managers of investment funds and investors are reminded of legal repercussions which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of asset management, in particular Directive 2009/65/EC on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities

See also the "Notice to stakeholders
ithdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in the field of Markets in Financial Instruments" (https://ec.europa.eu/info/brexit/brexit-preparedness_en).

1. UK ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY  UK UCITS management companies and UK AIF managers will no longer benefit from authorisation
(they will lose the so-called "EU passport") and will be treated as third-country AIF managers. This means that those UK entities will no longer be able to manage funds and market funds in the EU on the basis of their current authorisations
o For UCITS, EuVECA, EuSEF and ELTIF, both the investment funds and their managers must be established and registered or authorised in the EU to manage and market funds to retail
and professional investors across the Union.
AIF managers need to be established and authorised in the EU to be allowed to manage and market AIFs to professional investors across the EU.
As a consequence, all collective investment undertakings registered or authorised in the United Kingdom will be non-EU alternative investment funds (non-EU AIFs). This applies to:
Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS)
Alternative investment funds (AIFs)
European Venture Capital Funds (EuVECA);

European Social Entrepreneurship Funds (EuSEF);10
European Long Term Investment Funds (ELTIF);11 and
Money Market Funds (MMF).12
Member States may allow AIF managers who are not established and authorised in the EU to market AIFs (EU AIFs and non-EU AIFs) only in their territory under the so-called National Private Placement regimes13
hereafter "NPPR"). Directive 2011/61/EU provides Member States with discretion as to whether to activate NPPR and allow for stricter rules in addition to the minimum requirements in that Directive. Some Member States do not allow for the NPPR, while other Member States only allow marketing to professional investors.

8 EuVECA and EuSEF can only be marketed to retail investors subject to limitations in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 345/2013 and Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 346/2013. ELTIF can only be marketed to retail investors subject to limitations in Article 28 of Regulation (EU) 2015/760.

Directive 2011/61/EU includes a minimum set of conditions under NPPR for (i) third country entities (e.g. non-EU managers should comply with some requirements of Directive 2011/61/EU such as annual report, disclosure to investors and reporting), and (ii) for the third country (e.g. appropriate cooperation agreements must be in place between the EU competent authority and the relevant third country authorities).
3  UCITS management companies or AIF managers authorised by EU-27 competent authorities in accordance with Article 6 of Directive 2009/65/EC or Article 6 of Directive 2011/61/EU which are subsidiaries of entities established in the United Kingdom (legally independent companies established in EU-27 controlled by or affiliated to entities established in the United Kingdom) can continue to operate on the basis of their authorisation as UCITS management companies or AIF managers in the EU-27.
Branches of UK managers (permanent presences which are not legally independent from the AIF manager) in the EU will be treated as branches of a non-EU AIF managers as of the withdrawal date. These branches will be subject to the requirements of NPPRs, where available.
2. EU ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY  As of the withdrawal date, UCITS and AIFs authorised or registered in the United Kingdom in accordance with the Directive 2009/65/EC or Directive 2011/61/EU will be non-EU AIFs (see above)
EU-27 UCITS management companies managing those (former) UCITS authorised in the UK will need to obtain an authorisation according to Article 6 of Directive 2011/61/EU to manage non-EU AIFs.
The management, by AIF managers established and authorised or registered in the EU, of non-EU AIFs that are not marketed in the EU must comply with Directive 2011/61/EU (except depositary and annual report rules) and cooperation agreements for exchange of information between EU competent authorities and the relevant third country authorities (Article 34 of Directive 2011/61/EU).
According to Article 36 of Directive 2011/61/EU, the marketing of non-EU AIFs managed by an AIF manager established and authorised or registered in the EU is subject to the NPPR, which is an option for Member States. Stricter rules may be imposed on this category of AIF managers by Member States.
According to the rules on disclosure to investors in Directive 2009/65/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU, UCITS management companies and AIF managers must take a number of steps to inform investors of the consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, in particular:
-
According to Article 22 of Directive 2011/61/EU, AIF managers must include in the annual report any material change to the information to be disclosed to investors, which includes, but is not limited to, the legal implications of the contractual relationship.
-
According to Article 78 of Directive 2009/65/EC, UCITS management companies must prepare a key investor information document whose essential elements must be kept up to date. This includes information on Member States in which the management company is authorised, where the UCITS is managed or marketed cross-border.
4 Therefore, UCITS management companies and AIF managers must assess whether the change of the legal status of the investment fund would still be compliant with the investment strategy of the fund as communicated earlier to investors.  As regards the assets in which EU funds invest, Directive 2009/65/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU do not prohibit investment in eligible assets located outside the EU. Nevertheless, there will be restrictions to fund-of-funds structures; in particular UCITS authorised in the EU-27 must assess the eligibility of (former) UCITS authorised in the United Kingdom.14
EU investors should review their investment criteria to assess compliance with the change in the legal status of the funds they invested into (e.g. non-EU AIF instead of UCITS).
The delegation of certain operational functions to providers established in the United Kingdom may be undertaken provided that the relevant requirements in Directive 2009/65/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU are complied with.15 In particular, where the delegation concerns portfolio management or risk management (or investment management for UCITS) and is conferred on an undertaking established in a third country, a cooperation agreement between the competent authority of the home Member State of the UCITS management company or AIF manager and the supervisory authority of the undertaking carrying out the delegated function in the third country must be in place. Moreover, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA
has issued an opinion with specific clarifications on these matters, in particular on the risks of letter-box entities which may arise from the use of outsourcing arrangements or from the use of non-EU branches for the performance of functions/services with respect to EU clients. The use of non-EU branches needs to be based on objective reasons linked to the services provided in the non-EU jurisdiction and may not result in a situation where such non-EU branches perform material functions or provide material services back into the EU.16
According to Article 21 of Directive 2011/61/EU and Article 23 of Directive 2009/65/EC, the depository of EU AIF and UCITS authorised in the EU must be located in the home Member State of the fund. Article 22a of Directive 2009/65/EC and Article 21(11) of Directive 2011/61/EU lay down requirements for delegation of safekeeping functions to a third party.

INANCIAL SERVICES The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreemen

The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement

ERIVATIVES   As of the withdrawal date, derivatives traded on a UK regulated market will no longer fulfil the definition of exchange traded derivatives (ETDs) under EU law. According to Article 2(32) of
FIR
ETDs are derivatives traded on
EU regulated market, or on a third-country market considered to be equivalent.
Thus, under EU law10, as of the withdrawal date, ETDs traded on a UK regulated market will be over-the-counter (OTC
derivative contracts.
An ETD that becomes an OTC derivative will thus become subject to all EMIR requirements applicable to OTC derivatives transactions: all OTC derivatives transactions count towards the calculation of the clearing threshold in accordance with the provisions of EMIR11
and will be subject to the EMIR clearing obligation where one has been adopted12 as well as certain risk mitigation techniques (notably the exchange of margins).
OTC derivatives that are subject to the clearing obligation must be cleared by a central counterparty
CCP
which is authorised and established in a Member State of the EU or a CCP established in a third-country and which is recognised by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) under Article 25 of EMIR to clear that class of OTC derivative.13 As of the withdrawal date, CCPs established in the United Kingdom will be third-country CCPs which would need to be recognised under EMIR before they could be used to fulfil the clearing obligation.14 Counterparties will not be

An ETD is "a derivative that is traded on a regulated market or on a third-country market considered to derivative as defined in Article 2(7) of EMIR", see Article 2(32) of MIFIR. 10
OTC derivative contracts are those not traded on an EU regulated market or traded on third-country regulated market that is not subject to an equivalence decision

able to fulfil their clearing obligation under EMIR in
CPs established in the United Kingdom as long as those CCPs are not recognised by ESMA under EMIR
The obligation to clear transactions through an authorised CCP established in the EU or
recognised CCP established in a third country also applies to counterparties established in third countries, where the contract has a direct, substantial and foreseeable effect within the EU or where such an obligation is necessary or appropriate to prevent the evasion of any provisions of EMIR.15
The loss of EU authorisation of CCPs established in the United Kingdom will affect their ability to continue performing certain activities (e.g. compression) and fulfilling certain obligations (e.g. default management) with regard to contracts concluded before the withdrawal date
A higher capital charge will apply to exposures resulting from positions in derivatives held by credit institutions and investment firms established in the EU in non-recognised CCPs established in third countries16. This is because only authorised CCPs established in the EU and recognised CCPs established in a third country are qualifying CCPs17

which have a favourable treatment under CRR.18
Counterparties in the EU and counterparties in third countries to which the clearing obligation applies should therefore examine their derivatives portfolios. All counterparties (including counterparties established in third countries)
be they a financial institution or a non-financial company above the clearing threshold, should ensure that they fulfil the clearing requirements. Where derivatives are concluded via an intermediary or cleared via an intermediary (i.e. clearing member, client of a clearing member or an indirect client), counterparties should ensure that their contract with that intermediary
uly complies with the applicable legal requirements.  2.
RADE REPOSITORIES AND REPORTING  Derivatives or securities financing transactions which are subject to the reporting obligation under EMIR or SFTR must be reported by counterparties to an EU                                                                                                                                                  counterparty, the registration and supervision of trade repositories and the requirements for trade repositories

UTHORISATION
UK investment firms will no longer benefit from the MiFID authorisation
to provide MiFID investment services and activities in the Union
(they will lose the so-called "EU passport") and will be third-country firms. This means that those investment firms will no longer be allowed to provide services in the EU on the basis of their current authorisation
8  EU-27
ubsidiaries (legally independent companies established in EU-27 and controlled by or affiliated to investment firms established in the United Kingdom) can continue to operate as EU investment firms if they have a MiFID authorisation in one of the EU Member States. These firms, like any other MiFID firm, will comply with MiFID requirements amongst others in terms of substance requirements (including governance, outsourcing or the use of branches in a third-country to provide services back in the EU
9 Such firm's business model and structure (including links with non-EU entities) will be part of MiFID competent authorities' assessment (e.g. qualifying shareholders, the group business model/structure, the potential (prudential) consolidated supervision or lack thereof, etc.).
Branches in the EU-27 of UK established investment firms will be branches of third-country investment firms and will need to comply with national requirements applicable in the Member State where the branch is established or with the regime set in Article 39-41 MiFID II where applicable
The provision of services/activities is limited to that Member State's territory.
Article 5 MiFID II. Credit institutions authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU may also provide investment services and activities. Before granting an authorisation under Directive 2013/36/EU, relevant competent authorities should verify that they comply with relevant MiFID provisions. See Notice to stakeholders on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in the field of banking and payment services.
Annex I to MiFID II provides a list of services and activities and financial instruments covered by the MiFID framework.
The benefit of the MiFID passport will therefore be limited to investment firms established in the EU having obtained a MiFID authorisation in accordance with the authorisation and substance requirements set out in the MiFID framework. See also ESMA Opinion
General Principles to support supervisory convergence in the context of the UK withdrawing from the EU (https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma42-110-433_general_principles_to_support_supervisory_convergence_in_the_context_of_the_uk_withdrawing_from_the_eu.pdf), ESMA Opinion to support supervisory convergence in the area of investment firms in the context of the United Kingdom withdrawing from the European Union

See also above ESMA opinions and specific clarifications on these matters
in particular on the risk
of letter-box entities which may arise from the use of outsourcing arrangements or from the use of non-EU branches for the performance of functions/services with respect to EU clients. The use of non-EU branches needs to be based on objective reasons linked to the services provided in the non-EU jurisdiction and does not result in a situation where such non-EU branches perform material functions or provide services back into the EU.
UK market operators/investment firms operating a trading venue or execution venue will no longer benefit from the MiFID authorisation/licence10. UK based regulated markets (RMs), multilateral trading facilities (MTFs
or systematic internalisers (SI) will thus cease to be eligible venues for trading shares subject to the MiFIR share trading obligation
EU counterparts can no longer undertake trades in shares subject to the trading obligation on such platforms.11 Similarly, UK based RMs, MTFs or organised trading facilities (OTFs
will cease to be eligible venues for the purposes of the MiFIR derivative
trading obligation12 and EU counterparts will no longer be able to undertake trades on these platforms. In both cases, EU counterparts would need to reassess their trading arrangements to ensure continue
compliance with their obligations under the MiFID framework
Where previously available, UK based trading venues and CCPs13 will no longer benefit from the open and non-discriminatory access to EU trading venues and EU central counterparties (CCPs) and to EU benchmarks respectively.  2.
ONTRACTS  The loss of MiFID authorisations may also impact relationships with EU clients/counterparts and may affect the ability of UK established firms to continue performing certain obligations and activities deriving from existing contracts.14 Under MiFID15 firms are required to take measures to ensure continuity in the performance of investment services and activities. To this end, firms should assess the impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU on their operations and identify and mitigate compliance risk
For instance, EU established firms dealing in financial instruments subject to the MiFID trading obligation would no longer be able to use certain UK established firms/venues. Also, clients can no longer have direct electronic access to EU established trading venues via UK established firms. Further, UK established UCITS will become non-EU AIFs and EU established investment firms may be no longer                                                  10

he outsourcing of certain operational functions to UK providers may be undertaken only when in compliance with relevant MiFID requirements.16
n particular, the outsourcing of functions related to portfolio management to UK entities will only be permitted where the conditions under Article 32 of the MiFID Delegated Regulation 2017/565 are met, including the requirement that cooperation arrangements between National Competent Authorities and UK competent authorities are in place
Moreover, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA

In light of MiFID obligations on disclosure of information to clients, firms providing investment services are required to provide clients or potential clients with accurate disclosure, in good time and in any case before clients are bound by any contract, on the impact on the provision of services and investors' rights that may emerg
from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU including the upcoming loss by the firm of its MiFID authorisation.18

in good time about any material change to the information already provided, including if any material changes occurs to the situation of the firm and any resulting consequences for contracts.19

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF INSURANCE
REINSURANCE The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties
In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, insurance/reinsurance undertakings, policyholders and other stakeholders are reminded of certain legal repercussions which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of insurance/reinsurance, (in particular the Solvency II Directive
and the Insurance Distribution Directive5) setting out the framework governing the activities of insurance/reinsurance undertakings across the EU, the protection of policyholders and the distribution of insurance products no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences:
Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.

1.
UTHORISATION
UK insurance undertakings will no longer benefit from the Solvency II authorisation
to provide services in the Union (they will lose the so-called "EU passport") and will be third-country insurance undertakings. This means that those insurance undertakings will no longer be allowed to provide services in the EU, including through online sales
on the basis of their current authorisations.
Branches of UK insurance undertakings in the EU will be branches of third-country insurance undertakings. They will need an authorisation in the Member State of their activity to be able to continue to do business and have to comply with the conditions set out in Article 162 of the Solvency II Directive
The authorisation of a branch however does not grant the right to conduct business across the EU Member States, but only in the Member States that has granted the authorisation
EU-27 subsidiaries (legally independent companies established in EU-27 and controlled by or affiliated to insurance undertakings established in the United Kingdom) can continue to operate as EU insurance undertakings on the basis of their authorisation in the EU Member State of their establishment and subject to their compliance with the EU rules, including in terms of governance, risk management, and outsourcing
UK reinsurance undertakings will have to comply, for their EU business, with the conditions set by the EU Member State in which they carry out their activity. These conditions cannot be more favourable than those applying to reinsurance companies from the EU
but they may be less favourable and may well differ between EU Member States
for example
Member States are free to require the pledging of assets or the establishment of a branch by the third country reinsurer. This is without prejudice to any equivalence decision that may be adopted by the EU,10 whereby reinsurance contracts concluded with undertakings having their head office in that third country must be treated by EU Member States in the same manner as reinsurance contracts concluded with undertakings authorised in accordance with Solvency II.

NSURANCE CONTRACTS  Contract continuity: The loss of EU authorisation may affect the ability of UK insurance undertakings to continue performing certain obligations and activities and ensure service continuity with regard to contracts concluded before the withdrawal date.11 According to the Solvency II Directive firms are required to take measures to ensure that contracts can continue to be serviced. To this end, firms should assess the impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on their operations and contract portfolios and, also in cooperation with the relevant national supervisors, identify and mitigate risk
12 3.
THER ASPECTS  Information disclosure: According to Articles 183-186 of the Solvency II Directive and Articles 17-25 of Directive (EU) 2016/97, policyholders/customers should be informed about the impact on their rights and on the provision of insurance services that may emerge from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, including the upcoming loss by the relevant insurance undertaking/intermediary of its EU authorisation.  Group supervision: Insurance/reinsurance undertakings operating in the EU but part of a group with the parent undertaking registered in the United Kingdom will be subject, in the absence of equivalence supervision,13 to the Solvency II provisions empowering EU supervisory authorities to require a worldwide group solvency or to apply other methods aiming to ensure appropriate group level supervision including the establishment of a holding company with head office in the Union.14 Any group-level internal model covering a UK group operating in the EU, approved by the UK Prudential Regulatory Authority before the withdrawal date will no longer be recognised in the EU as of the withdrawal date, and will require a new application and approval by an EU-27 supervisor. Any entity-level internal model for a subsidiary of an UK insurance undertaking established in one of the EU-27 Member States and approved by the supervisor of that Member State will remain valid.

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF INSTITUTIONS FOR OCCUPATIONAL RETIREMENT PROVISION
The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date or the period is extended by the European Council in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date'). The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision ("IORPs"), IORP members and beneficiaries, undertakings sponsoring IORPs and other stakeholders are reminded of certain legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules for IORPs, and in particular Directive (EU) 2016/2341 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2016 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision
no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences:  As of the withdrawal date, IORPs registered or authorised in the United Kingdom will no longer benefit from the registration or authorisation under Directive (EU) 2016/2341
to provide services in the Union and will be treated as third-country undertakings, to which Directive (EU) 2016/2341 does not apply. This means that, as of the withdrawal date, those IORPs will no longer be allowed to operate, on the basis of their current registration/authorisation as IORPs for members or beneficiaries whose relationship with the sponsoring undertaking is governed by the social and labour law relevant to the field of occupational pension schemes of a

This Directive will repeal Directive 2003/41/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 June 2003 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (OJ L 235, 23.9.2003, p. 10). It will have to be applied by Member States from 13 January 2019 at the latest.
Article
9, 11 and 12 of Directive (EU) 2016/2341

Member State (hereafter "EU-27 members and beneficiaries")
The assets will be in the United Kingdom and members and beneficiaries will have to rely on UK national law to have access to their assets.
As of the withdrawal date, IORPs registered or authorised in the United Kingdom will have to comply, with regard to activities related to EU-27 members and beneficiaries, with the rules of the host Member State applicable to activities of IORPs registered or authorised in a third country. These rules may require a registration or authorisation by the relevant competent authority of the host Member State in accordance with the applicable national rules. Such registration or authorisation does, however, not grant the right to conduct business across the EU Member States, but is limited to the Member State that has granted the registration or authorisation.
Before the withdrawal date, IORPs registered or authorised in the UK which are active cross-border in the EU-27 should contact the competent authorities of the relevant host EU-27 Member States to determine whether and under which conditions they might be allowed to continue their activities pursuant to national law in this Member State. Depending on the outcome, they might have to take contingency measures:
o
f it is not possible to continue the cross-border operations into an EU-27 Member State, UK IORPs may decide to transfer their portfolio related to EU-27 members and beneficiaries to a receiving IORP registered or authorised in EU-27, in order to keep such members and beneficiaries under the EU IORP framework. Article 12 of Directive (EU) 2016/2341, which has to be transposed at the latest by 13 January 2019, provides for a transfer procedure.
If a transfer is not performed, the UK IORP will no longer be able to continue to operate the pension schemes of its EU-27 members and beneficiaries, and the consequences for its EU-27 members and beneficiaries are as described above

If the Member State allows continued cross-border activities under its national law, the IORPs would have to decide whether to rely on these rules or to transfer the portfolio.

ponsoring undertakings established in the EU-27 that pay contributions to an IORP registered or authorised in the United Kingdom should assess the conditions for the continuation of the relevant schemes on the basis of the national law of the Member State in which they are established. In any event, as of the withdrawal date
such pension schemes will no longer benefit from the legal framework provided by Directive (EU) 2016/2341. If the host Member State does not allow the continued cross-border activities of the UK IORP, sponsoring undertakings will have to make sure that the IORP in question is either transferred or that they find an alternative IORP. Sponsoring undertakings established in the United Kingdom that pay contributions to an IORP registered or authorised in the EU-27 with regard to a pension scheme for members or beneficiaries whose relationship with the sponsoring
As long as Member States have not transposed Directive (EU) 2016/2341, Directive 2003/41/EC applies. Directive 2003/41/EC does not provide for a transfer procedure. However, a transfer may be possible on the basis of an agreement between the authorities of the transferring and receiving IORPs. In this case, IORPs could therefore already initiate such a transfer.
undertaking is governed by EU-27 social and labour law will be able to continue doing so
and be subject to Directive (EU) 2016/2341.
As of the withdrawal date, members and beneficiaries whose relationship with the sponsoring undertaking of an EU-27 IORP is governed by the social and labour law of the United Kingdom relevant to the field of occupational pension schemes ("UK members and beneficiaries"
will no longer benefit from the legal framework set by Directive (EU) 2016/2341, even if the IORP is registered or authorised in the EU-27
Whether and under which regulatory framework the EU-27 IORP is allowed to provide services to members and beneficiaries in a third country has to be assessed under the national rules applicable to the IORP.
Contract continuity: The loss of EU registration/authorisation may also affect the ability of IORPs registered or authorised in the United Kingdom to continue performing certain obligations and activities and ensure service continuity with regard to contracts concluded before the withdrawal date
IORPs, undertakings sponsoring IORPs and other stakeholders should assess the impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom on their operations and contractual arrangements and, also in cooperation with the relevant national supervisors and with the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)
identify and mitigate compliance risks.
According to Article 37(3) of Directive (EU) 2016/2341, IORP members and beneficiaries have to receive, within a reasonable time, any relevant information regarding changes to the pension scheme rules. This includes information on the impact on their rights and the provision of IORP services emerging from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, since the withdrawal may trigger changes to their pension scheme rules

ONSEQUENCES FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF ECONOMIC OPERATORS Pursuant to Article 5(3) of Directive 2007/46/EC, manufacturers established outside the Union must appoint a representative established in the Union to represent them before the Member State type-approval authorities.  Manufacturers' representatives established in the United Kingdom will not, as from the withdrawal date, be considered as established in the Union for the purposes of Article 5(3). Therefore, to the extent that Directive 2007/46/EC is still relevant to their activities, manufacturers established outside the Union are advised to take the necessary steps to ensure that, as from the withdrawal date, their appointed representatives are established in the EU-27. 2.
ONSEQUENCES FOR TYPE-APPROVAL
AND TYPE-APPROVAL AUTHORITIES Motor vehicles within the scope of Directive 2007/46/EC may only be registered, sold and enter into service if they are accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity issued by the manufacturer attesting that the vehicles have been manufactured in conformity with the E
type-approval granted by a Member State authority.10
For the purposes of Directive 2007/46/EC, "approval authority" means "the authority of a Member State with competence for all aspects of the approval of a type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit or of the individual approval of a vehicle; for the authorisation process, for issuing and, if appropriate, withdrawing approval certificates; for acting as the contact point for the approval authorities of other Member

This means that, as from that date, the United Kingdom approval authority will cease to be an EU type-approval authorit
under Directive 2007/46/EC. As a result, it will not be possible as from the withdrawal date for a manufacturer to place on the Union market motor vehicles accompanied by a certificate of conformity referring to a type-approval granted by the United Kingdom approval authority formerly competent under EU law. In particular, the United Kingdom
pproval authority will no longer be in a position to perform any of the functions and activities of an approval authority for the purposes of Directive 2007/46/EC with respect to type-approvals it granted prior to the withdrawal date
Moreover, the United Kingdom approval authority will no longer be able to issue revisions or extensions to such approvals on the basis of Article 14 of Directive 2007/46/EC. With respect to type-approvals granted by the United Kingdom authority prior to the withdrawal date

egulation
(EU) No 167/2013 and (EU) No 168/2013 define "approval authority" as "the authority of a Member State established or appointed by the Member State and notified to the Commission by the Member State with competence for all aspects of the approval of a type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit, for the authorisation process, for issuing and, if appropriate, withdrawing or refusing approval certificates, for acting as the contact point for the approval authorities of other Member States, for designating the technical services and for ensuring that the manufacturer meets his obligations regarding the conformity of production
12
Engines for non-road mobile machinery within the scope of Regulation (EU) No 2016/1628 or non-road mobile machinery in which such engines are installed may only be placed on the market if the engine is covered by a valid EU type-approval.13
Regulation (EU) No 2016/1628 defines "approval authority" as "the authority of a Member State established or appointed by the Member State and notified by it to the Commission and which has  competence for: (a) all aspects of the EU type-approval of an engine or of an engine family; (b) the authorisation process; (c)  granting and, where appropriate, withdrawing or refusing EU type-approval and issuing EU type-approval certificates; (d) acting as the contact point for the approval authorities of other Member States; (e ) designating the technical services; and (f) ensuring that the manufacturer meets its obligations regarding conformity of production." 14
As from the withdrawal date, the Regulation
will cease to apply to the United Kingdom. This means that, as from that date, the United Kingdom approval authority will cease to be an EU type-approval authorit
under the Regulation
As a result, it will not be possible as from the withdrawal date for a manufacturer to place on the Union market: (i) vehicles within the scope of Regulations (EU) No 167/2013 and (EU) No 168/2013 accompanied by a certificate of conformity referring to a type-approval granted by the United Kingdom approval authority formerly competent under EU law; (ii) engines for non-road mobile machinery or non-road mobile machinery in which such engines are installed for which a type-approval was granted by the United Kingdom approval authority formerly competent under EU law.

respectively. A.
CONCEPT OF GOODS PLACED ON THE UNION (EU-27) MARKET BEFORE THE WITHDRAWAL DATE In the event of the UK leaving the EU without a ratified withdrawal agreement, Union type-approval legislation will cease to apply to and in the UK on the withdrawal date. This means that, as from that date, the UK type-approval authority will cease to be a type-approval authority under Union type-approval legislation. As a result, placing on the Union (EU-27) market of products manufactured on the basis of a UK type-approval will no longer be possible as of the withdrawal date.
The relevant criterion to determine the extent to which there may be consequences from the UK withdrawal for a specific vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit manufactured on the basis of a UK type-approval is therefore whether that product was placed on the Union (EU-27) market before the withdrawal date
requirements applicable to a specific product: a product must comply with the applicable Union legislation at the time of its placing on the market6.
In this regard, Regulation (EU) 2019/26 recalls that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units must conform to the requirements applicable at the time of their placing on the market. The concept of "placing on the market in the Union (EU-27)" must therefore be the concept used also in this framework.
lacing on the market' mean
the first supply of a product for distribution, consumption or use i
the Union (EU-27) market in the course of a commercial activity, whether in return for payment or free of charge7. Placing on the market requires an offer or agreement between two or more legal or natural persons for the transfer of ownership, possession or any other property right concerning a specific product after the stage of manufacture has taken place. The concept of placing on the market refers to each individual product, not to a type of product. Moreover, placing on the market does not require physical delivery of the product but does require that the manufacturing stage has been completed
These principles apply to the automotive sector as harmonised at EU-level as no deviating provisions are laid down in the harmonised legislation of the sector.
ehicles, complete or incomplete
shall be equipped with a valid certificate of conformity (CoC) based on a valid type-approval by the time of their placing on the EU-27 market
This means that vehicles, complete or incomplete, which were placed on the EU-27 market with a CoC based on a valid UK type-approval prior to the withdrawal

) of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93, OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30. The market surveillance provisions included in this Regulation are applicable in the context of Directive 2007/46/EC on the approval of motor vehicles. See also Regulation
(EU) No 167/2013, (EU) No 168/2013 and (EU) 2016/1628

3 date may continue to be made available on the EU-27 market. Without prejudice to the application of the provisions on the placing on the market, registration and entry into service of end-of-series vehicles,
registration and entry into service as of the withdrawal date will be possible under the conditions set out in Regulations (EU) 2019/26 (see Section B below)
As of the withdrawal date, vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units can only be placed on the EU-27 market with a CoC based on a Union (EU-27) type-approval.  1. Vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units physically in the distribution chain or already in use
n the EU-27 market on the withdrawal date
Example
: Tyres already with an EU-27 importer or a motor vehicle already with
EU-27 dealer
These products are considered as placed on the Union (EU-27) market before the withdrawal date and can therefore continue to be made available in the EU-27 market (provided the vehicles are equipped with a valid CoC) or remain in use with no need for a (new) Union type
pproval, re-labelling/re-marking or product modifications. This is without prejudice to the obligation to appoint a new representative' established in the EU-27 where the current one is UK-based and intends to place products on the EU-27 market as of the withdrawal date
Example B: An unfinished truck manufactured in the Union (EU-27) prior to the withdrawal date, based on a UK type-approval, subject to multistage production, equipped with a valid CoC and supplied for further assembly or completion in the Union (EU-27) prior to the withdrawal date
This example concerns a multistage vehicle where the first stage comprises the chassis-cab (i.e. an incomplete vehicle).  In case of a truck, a chassis-cab may be type-approved as the first stage for a vehicle manufacturer, and a bodybuilder (i.e. third party) holds the approval for a subsequent second and final stage. A truck could also be built in multistage procedure by the same manufacturer. In case the incomplete vehicle can be considered having been placed on the EU-27 market, on the basis of a commercial transaction between two entities for the purposes of distribution or use in the EU-27 market prior to the UK withdrawal, the approach is the same as for the products under Example A.
2. Vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units manufactured either in a third country or in the Union (EU-27) on the basis of a UK type-approval, supplied to an importer/ative in the EU-27 or sold to an EU-27 dealer or customer before the withdrawal date after the manufacturing stage was completed but not yet physically delivered to the EU-27 customer until after the UK withdrawal
Example: A non-road mobile machinery engine manufactured in the US on the basis of a UK type-approval is sold to an EU-27 importer or an original equipment manufacturer of non-road mobile machinery on 28 March 2019 (i.e. date of
Article 27(3) of Directive 2007/46/EC, Article 39(3) of Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 and Article 44(3) of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013. Cf. also recitals 15 and 19 of the preamble to Regulation (EU) No 2019/26.
placing on the market, date of the transaction) but will only arrive at the Union customs on 5 June 2019.
Same as the products under No. 1. The date of placing on the Union (EU-27) market is the date of the transaction between the manufacturer and the EU-27 importer or original equipment manufacturer provided that the manufacturing stage has been completed by that date. Placing on the market does not require physical delivery of the product.
3. Vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units manufactured on the basis of a UK type-approval, either imported into the UK from a third country or manufactured in the UK before the withdrawal date
subsequently sold to an EU-27 customer as of the withdrawal date.
Example
An incomplete vehicle manufactured in Japan based on
UK type-approval and accompanied by a CoC is sold to a UK bodybuilder on 25 February 2019 and imported by the latter into the UK on 10 March 2019. The UK bodybuilder then sells it to a
EU-27 dealer on 20 April 2019 and the complete vehicle arrives at the Union customs on 30 April 2019.
In this example, the incomplete vehicle is placed on the Union (EU-27) market after the withdrawal date as the date of its first making available to an EU-27 customer is on or after the withdrawal date. The incomplete vehicle is considered as a product imported from a third country and will have to fully comply with the provisions of Union law applicable at the time of its placing on the market.
Products placed on the EU-27 market as of the withdrawal date need to be accompanied by a CoC referring to
type-approval issued by an EU-27 type-approval authority
4. Vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units manufactured in a third country on the basis of a UK type-approval after the withdrawal date.
Example:
car manufactured in China based on
UK type-approval on 5 April 2019 is sold to an EU-27 dealer on 15 April 2019 and arrives at the Union customs on 1 June 2019.
In this example, the car cannot be placed on the Union (EU-27) market based on a CoC referring to the UK type-approval. Same as in the situation under No. 3
5. How can proof of placing on the market before the withdrawal date be given? Proof of placing on the market can be given on the basis of any relevant document ordinarily used in business transactions (e.g. contract of sale concerning goods which have already been manufactured, invoice, documents concerning the shipping of goods to distribution or similar commercial documents). In practice, such proof will need to be given in case of checks upon importation into the Union (EU-27) or in case of checks by market surveillance authorities or at the time of registration, for products subject to that requirement
The documentary evidence provided must make it possible to verify that it corresponds to the individual goods and quantity presented to customs or checked by market surveillance
authorities or for which registration is requested, for example, with the reference to the specific identification element
of the products. B.
RANTING OF UNION TYPE-APPROVALS IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATION (EU) 2019/26
Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2019/26 provides that a manufacturer holding a valid UK type-approval may, until the Union type-approval legislation ceases to apply to and in the United Kingdom, submit an application to a Union (EU-27) type-approval authority for a Union type-approval of the same type.
1. New Union type-approval granted and taking effect before the withdrawal date
Under this scenario, the old UK type-approval will become invalid as of the date
n which the new Union type-approval takes effect.
Article 5
), third subparagraph, of Regulation (EU) 2019/26 provides that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units produced on the basis of a UK type-approval which has become invalid as a result of the granting of a Union type-approval before the withdrawal date may be placed on the market, registered and entered into service in the Union until Union type-approval legislation ceases to apply to and in the United Kingdom. Where the UK type-approval becomes invalid before that date for other reasons
the vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units can only be placed on the market, registered and entered into service in the Union until the date on which the Union type-approval becomes invalid. For vehicles, manufacturers will have to indicate the new Union type-approval number in a supplement to the CoC
Recital 17 in the preamble to Regulation (EU) 2019/26 clarifies that, of placing on the market, of registration, and of entry into service can differ, the moment when the first of those steps has been undertaken should be used to determine the time limits set out in this Regulationtechnical unit placed on the market before the withdrawal date under the conditions set out in Article 5(6), third subparagraph, may be registered and entered into service also on or after the withdrawal date.

New Union type-approval granted on or after the withdrawal date
It is foreseeable that a Union type-approval authority, despite all good intentions, may not be able to process all the applications of different manufactures on time, i.e. prior to the withdrawal date. It is therefore possible that the new Union type-approval
replacing the previous UK type-approval
will be issued only on or after the withdrawal date.
In such a case

Vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units produced on the basis of a UK type-approval for which a Union type-approval for the same type has been requested in accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/26 and which have been placed on the EU-27 market before the withdrawal date may be registered and enter into service also on or after the withdrawal date, pending the granting of the new Union type-approval. For vehicles, manufacturers will have to present proof to the competent authorities of the Member State where registration and entry into service is sought that
they have submitted an application to a Union type-approval authority for a Union type-approval of the same type in accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/26.

As of the withdrawal date, production of vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units intended to be placed on the EU-27 market can only take place on the basis of a type-approval granted by an EU-27 type-approval authority.
C.
LARIFICATION ON THE (IN)VALIDITY OF TYPE-APPROVALS ISSUED UNDER DIRECTIVE 97/68/EC
Both Recital 20 and Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 2019/26 are based on the assumption that the type-approvals, which fall under the exemptions and transitional provisions provided in either Directive 97/68/EC or Regulation (EU) 2016/1628, have become invalid.  Directive 97/68/EC does not contain an Article equivalent to Article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 that specifies when type-approvals become invalid.
However, Article 10(2) of Directive 97/68/EC contained an end-of-series provision that relie
upon the principle that a type-approval issued for an engine category of a given emission stage becomes invalid from the date of mandatory application, for the purposes of the placing on the market, of the subsequent emission stage in Article 9(4) of that Directive
Therefore, type-approvals granted under Directive 97/68/EC are considered to become invalid through the mandatory application of new emission requirements for the placing on the market. This is in line with the provisions of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 2019/26

This notice should be read in conjunction with any complementary, more specific notices on the legal consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal that may be published with regard to any of the Union acts listed in the annex. 1.
ONSEQUENCES FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF ECONOMIC OPERATOR
According to Union product legislation, the importer is the economic operator
established in the Union wh
places a product from a third country on the Union market. As from the withdrawal date, a manufacturer or importer established in the United Kingdom will no longer be considered as an economic operator established in the Union. As a consequence, an economic operator established in the EU-27 who, prior to the withdrawal date, was considered as an EU distributor will become an importer for the purposes of Union product legislation in relation to products from a third country that this economic operator place
on the EU-27 market as from the withdrawal date. This operator will have to comply with the specific obligations relevant to an importer, which are different from those

distributor.10
Currently
Union product legislation does not generally oblige the manufacturer to designate an authorised representative.11 However, if the manufacturer choose
to do so, the applicable legislation requires the authorised representative to be established in the Union. In addition,
pecific Union legislation does provide for the obligation to have
The concept of placing on the market refers to each individual product and not to types of products, and whether it was manufactured as an individual unit or in series. For more information on the concept of placing on the market, see Chapter 2 of Commission Notice 2016/C 272/01 "The Blue Guide on the implementation of EU product rules 2016", OJ C 272, 26.7.2016, p. 1 (hereinafter referred to as "the Blue Guide")

This note does not deal with the placing on the UK market as from the withdrawal date.
Several elements are commonly present in the different pieces of EU product legislation, regardless of the harmonisation technique adopted by the legislator (e.g. the notion of placing on the market and making available of a product; the definitions of the economic operators). In addition to such common elements, Union legislation based on the so-called New Approach also shares the same approach to technical harmonisation, by setting out common requirements ("essential requirements", expressed in the form of performance requirements or objectives to be attained) on how a product has to be designed and manufactured to meet the required level of e.g. health, safety or environmental protection as well as the conformity assessment procedure, which is chosen from among a common set of modules, that has to be followed to demonstrate compliance with such requirements. For more information in this regard, please see the Blue Guide

Union product legislation defines as economic operators the manufacturer, the importer, the distributor and the authorised representative. 10

The Commission proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules and procedures for compliance with and enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation on products (COM (2017) 795 final of 19.12.2017: https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/26976
provides for the obligation to have a person responsible for compliance information established in the Union in respect of all products that are subject to the Union harmonisation legislation set out in the Annex to the proposed Regulation.
an authorised representative (e.g. Union legislation on medical devices12
transportable pressure equipment13 or marine equipment14) or a responsible person (cosmetic products15) established in the Union. Authorised representatives or responsible persons established in the United Kingdom will not, as from the withdrawal date, be recognised as authorised representatives or responsible persons for the purposes of the applicable Union product legislation. Therefore, manufacturers are advised to take the necessary steps to ensure that
as from the withdrawal date, their designated authorised representatives or responsible persons are established in the EU-27. 2.
ONSEQUENCES FOR CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES AND NOTIFIED BODIES In some product areas, Union legislation requires the intervention of a qualified third party, known as Notified Body, in the conformity assessment procedure.  Union product legislation requires Notified Bodies to be established in a Member State and be designated by a Member State notifying authority for performing the conformity assessment tasks set out in the relevant act of Union product legislation. Therefore, as from the withdrawal date, UK Notified Bodies will lose their status as EU Notified Bodies and will be removed from the Commission's information system on notified organisations (NANDO database16
As such, UK bodies will not be in a position to perform conformity assessment tasks pursuant to Union product legislation as from the withdrawal date.
hen the applicable conformity assessment procedure requires or provides for the possibility of third party intervention, a certificate delivered by
body recognised as an EU Notified Body at the time of the placing of that product on the market will be required for products placed on the market as from the withdrawal date.  Economic operators are advised to take the necessary steps to ensure that, where the applicable conformity assessment procedures require the intervention of a Notified Body, they will hold certificates issued by a
EU-27 Notified Body to demonstrate compliance for their products placed on the market as from the withdrawal date

4 Where economic operators hold certificates issued by a UK Notified Body prior to the withdrawal date and plan to continue placing the product concerned on the EU-27 market as from the withdrawal date, they are advised to consider either applying for a new certificate issued by a
EU-27 Notified Body or arranging for a transfer  on the basis of a contractual arrangement between the manufacturer, the UK Notified Body, and the EU-27 Notified Body
of the file and the corresponding certificate from the UK Notified Body to a
EU-27 Notified Body

EUROPEAN COMMISSION DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR INTERNAL MARKET, INDUSTRY, ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SMES
Brussels, 1 February 2019
UESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATED TO THE UNITED KINGDOM'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH REGARD TO
NDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS On 22 January 2018, the European Commission services published a "Notice to stakeholders  withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in the field of industrial products
('the Notice').
An indicative list of Union product legislation to which the
tice applies can be found in its Annex
This list of Questions and Answers (Q&A) give
further guidance on the basis of the Notice in a situation where the United Kingdom (UK) becomes a third country on 30 March 2019 at 00:00h (CET)
the withdrawal date') without a ratified withdrawal agreement and hence
without the transition period provided for in the draft Withdrawal Agreement; and
without the provisions in relation to "goods placed on the market" provided for in the draft Withdrawal Agreement. The list of Q&A may be further updated and complemented as necessary and should be read in conjunction with any complementary, more specific notices or Q&A on the legal consequences of the UK's withdrawal that have been or may be published with regard to any of the Union acts listed in the Annex to the Notice. A.
CONCEPT OF GOODS PLACED ON THE UNION (EU-27) MARKET BEFORE THE WITHDRAWAL DATE The relevant criterion to determine the extent to which there may be consequences from the UK withdrawal for a specific product covered by the Notice is whether a product was placed on the Union (EU-27) market before the withdrawal date
The concept of placing on the market refers to each individual product, not to a type of products, whether it was manufactured as an individual unit or in series.
It relates to the first making available on the Union (EU-27) market, i.e. the first supply of a good for distribution, consumption or use after the manufacturing stage. Placing on the market
https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/industrial_products_en_1.pdf
does not require physical delivery of the product but does require that the manufacturing stage has been completed
1. Goods physically in the distribution chain or already in use
n the EU-27 market on the withdrawal date
Example: a cosmetic product held in the EU-27 by a wholesaler with a view to onward distribution or already on the shelf of a department store
an X-ray machine (medical device) certified by a UK Notified Body held in the EU-27 by a wholesaler or already supplied to a hospital in the EU-27, where it is in use
These goods are considered as placed on the Union (EU-27) market before the withdrawal date and can therefore continue to be made available in the EU-27 market or remain in use with no need for re-certification, re-labelling or product modifications. This is without prejudice to the obligation to appoint a new 'responsible person
established in the EU-27 where the current one is UK-based as set out under Section B below.
2. Goods manufactured either in the EU or in a third country, sold to an EU-27 customer before the withdrawal date after the manufacturing stage was completed but not yet physically delivered to the EU-27 customer on that date.
Example: an X-ray machine manufactured in the US and certified by a UK Notified Body has been sold to a Dutch hospital on 15 March 2019 (=date of placing on the market, i.e. date of the transaction) but will only arrive at Dutch customs on 5 April 2019.
Same as the goods under Q&A No. 1. The date of placing on the Union (EU-27) market is the date of the transaction between the manufacturer and the EU-27 customer after the manufacturing stage was completed. Placing on the market does not require physical delivery of the product.
3. Goods imported into the UK from a third country or manufactured in the UK
subsequently sold to an EU-27 customer before the withdrawal date but physically delivered to the EU-27 customer as of that date
Example A: an X-ray machine manufactured in the US and certified by a UK Notified Body is sold to a UK wholesaler on 15 February 2019 and imported by the latter into the UK on 15 March 2019. The UK wholesaler then sells it to a Dutch hospital on 25 March 2019 and the X-ray machine arrives at Dutch customs on 5 April 2019.
Example B: an X
ay machine manufactured in the UK and certified by a UK Notified Body is sold either directly to the Dutch hospital or via a UK
For more information on the concept of placing on the market, see Chapter 2 of Commission Notice 2016/C 272/01 "The Blue Guide on the implementation of EU product rules 2016", OJ C 272, 26.7.2016, p. 1
3 distributor, in both cases the date of the transaction with the Dutch hospital is 25 March 2019, arrival at Dutch Customs on 5 April 2019
In both examples, same as the goods under Q&A No. 1 and 2. The date of placing on the Union (EU-27) market is the date of the transaction between the UK economic operator (manufacturer, importer or distributor) to the EU-27 customer. Placing on the market does not require physical delivery of the product.
4. Goods imported into the UK from a third country or manufactured in the UK before the withdrawal date
subsequently sold to an EU-27 customer as of the withdrawal date.
Example A:
circular saw
machinery) manufactured in the US and certified by a UK Notified Body is sold to a UK wholesaler on 15 February 2019 and imported by the latter into the UK on 15 March 2019. The UK wholesaler then sells it to a Dutch factory on 5 April 2019 and the circular saw arrives at Dutch customs on 15 April 2019.
Example B: a circular saw manufactured in the UK and certified by a UK NB is sold either directly to the Dutch factory or via a UK wholesaler, in both cases the date of the transaction with the Dutch factory is 5 April 2019, arrival at Dutch Customs on 15 April 2019.
In both examples, the goods are placed on the Union (EU-27) market after the withdrawal date as the date of their first making available to an EU-27 customer is on or after the withdrawal date. The goods are considered as imports from a third country and will have to fully comply with the provisions of Union law applicable at the time of their placing on the market. This means in particular that the goods will have to have been certified by an EU-27 Notified Body, where a third-party intervention in their conformity assessment is required. Where applicable, they will also have to indicate the details of the EU-27 importer and of an EU-27 'responsible person
3
5. How can proof of placing on the market before the withdrawal date be given? Proof of placing on the market can be given on the basis of any relevant document ordinarily used in business transactions (e.g. contract of sale concerning goods which have already been manufactured, invoice, documents concerning the shipping of goods to distribution or similar commercial documents). In practice, such proof will need to be given in case of checks upon importation into the Union (EU-27) or in case of checks by market surveillance authorities. The documentary evidence provided must make it possible to verify that it corresponds to the individual goods and quantity presented to customs or checked
Please note that, in addition, the EU rules for imports set out in the Union Customs Code, as well as in the EU VAT legislation apply. For more information, please refer to the applicable "Preparedness notices" published here: https://ec.europa.eu/info/brexit/brexit-preparedness/preparedness-notices_en#tradetaxud
4 by market surveillance authorities, for example, with the reference to the specific identification element of the goods. B.
ESPONSIBLE PERSONS
In some product areas, Union product legislation foresees 'responsible persons
who have specific tasks in relation to ensuring continued regulatory compliance and interfacing with market surveillance authorities. These 'responsible persons' must be established in the Union, for example: the responsible person for cosmetic products;
or authorised representatives, whose appointment by the manufacturer is generally voluntary but mandatory in
few sectors, notably: medical devices, transportable pressure equipment, marine equipment
UK-based responsible persons will lose their status as from the withdrawal date, regardless of when products were placed on the market.  Therefore, manufacturers need to ensure that, as from the withdrawal date, their designated responsible persons are established in the EU-27.
Where sector-specific databases exist (e.g. the Cosmetic Registration Portal, Eudamed for medical devices), the information on responsible persons is recorded in those databases and any change will therefore be traceable there.
1. Goods placed on the Union (EU-27) market before the withdrawal date
o need for relabelling with the contact details of the new EU-27 responsible persons. The information available in the existing databases or, absent those, information provided by economic operators to the competent national authorities concerning the appointment of a new EU-27 based responsible person shall suffice. 2. Goods placed on the EU-27 market as of the withdrawal date, whether coming from the UK or another third country These goods will have to fully comply with the provisions of Union law applicable at the time of their placing on the market. This means, inter alia, that when required they will have to indicate the details of an EU-27 'responsible person
C.
MPORTERS
According to Union product legislation, the importer is the economic operator established in the Union who places a product from a third country on the Union market. As from the withdrawal date, a manufacturer or importer established in the United Kingdom will no longer be considered as an economic operator established in the Union. Union legislation generally requires the contact details of the importer to be provided on the product itself or its label.
1. Products which were imported into the EU-28 via the UK and placed on the Union (EU-27) market before the withdrawal date

Regarding the EU rules for cosmetic products, see also the "Notice to stakeholders  withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in the field of cosmetic products" (https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/cosmetic_products_en_0.pdf).
Q&A No. 1 of Section A applies. No change to the labels is required.
2. Goods imported into the UK market before the withdrawal date and made available to the EU-27 market as of that date. For products entering the EU-27 market as from the withdrawal date in respect of which the EU-28 importer
used to be UK-based, EU-27 economic operators which were previously mere distributors of those products will become importers for the purposes of Union law when making those products available in the EU-27 market for the first time (i.e. placing them on the EU-27 market). This will require them to meet more stringent obligations as regards in particular verification of product compliance and, where applicable, the indication of their contact details on the product
Regarding the labelling of the importer, Q&A No. 4 of Section A applies: these goods are placed on the Union (EU-27) market after the withdrawal date and, will need to be relabelled with the indication of the EU-27 importer.  D.
RANSFER OF NOTIFIED BODY CERTIFICATES
In some product areas, Union product legislation requires the intervention of a qualified third party, known as Notified Body, in the conformity assessment procedure. Notified Bodies must be established in a Member State and designated by a Member State notifying authority for performing the conformity assessment tasks set out in the relevant act of Union product legislation.  The Notice recalls that for the purposes of placing products on the EU-27 market as of the withdrawal date a certificate of an EU-27 Notified Body will be required. It will therefore be necessary for economic operators to either apply for a new certificate with another EU-27 Notified Body, or arrange for a transfer of the file and the corresponding certificate to an EU-27 Notified Body, which would then take over the responsibility for that certificate. The transfer of certificates from a UK Notified Body to an EU-27 Notified Body needs to take place before the withdrawal date, on the basis of a contractual arrangement between the manufacturer, the UK Notified Body, and the EU-27 Notified Body.
1. I am a manufacturer of a product for which the certificate has been transferred from a UK Notified Body to an EU-27 Notified Body. Do the EU Declaration of Conformity and the actual Notified Body Certificate need to be updated to document this change?
Yes, for products placed on the EU-27 market after the withdrawal date both the EU Declaration of Conformity (drawn up by the manufacturer) and the Notified Body Certificate must be updated accordingly: these documents will need to mention that the certificate is now under the responsibility of an EU-27 Notified Body and indicate both the old UK and the new EU-27 Notified Body's details / identification numbers.
2. Does the Notified Body number on the product itself need to be changed also for products already on the market or manufactured before the transfer of the certificates occurred?
6
f the above mentioned product documentation is in order, no need to change the Notified Body number for products already placed on the EU-27 market or manufactured before the transfer of certificate has taken place and not yet placed on the EU-27 market. However, products manufactured after the transfer of the certificate has taken place should be marked with the new EU-27 Notified Body number and it will not be possible to continue to use the UK Notified Body number until the end of the validity of the original certificate issued by it
E.
ACCREDITATION
Accreditation is an attestation issued by a national accreditation body that a conformity assessment body meets the applicable requirements to carry out a specific conformity assessment activity. Accreditation is the preferred means of demonstrating the technical competence of Notified Bodies, unless Union product legislation provides otherwise. Regulation No 765/2008
sets out the legal framework for the organisation and operation of the European accreditation system. 1. What is the legal status under Union law
as from the withdrawal date, of accreditation certificates delivered by the UK Accreditation Service (UKAS)?
The UK Accreditation Service will cease to be a national accreditation body within the meaning and for the purposes of Regulation No 765/2008 as from the withdrawal date. As a consequence, its accreditation certificates will no longer be considered as 'accreditation
within the meaning of Regulation No 765/2008 and no longer valid or recognised in the EU-27 pursuant to that Regulation as of the withdrawal date

EUROPEAN COMMISSION DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR INTERNAL MARKET, INDUSTRY, ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SMES Brussels, 18 January 2018
OTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that, unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties
In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, economic operators are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country.
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date the EU rules in the field of public procurement no longer apply to the United Kingdom
This has in particular the following consequences for public procurement procedures launched by EU Member States authorities as of the withdrawal date

Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
For public procurement procedures that are ongoing on the withdrawal date, the EU is trying to agree solutions with the United Kingdom in the withdrawal agreement.

Thus, all guarantees associated with EU Public Procurement Law will cease to apply to economic operators interested or participating in public procurement procedures in the United Kingdom. See https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/public_procurement.pdf for a list of instruments forming part of the EU Public Procurement Law acquis.
2
conomic operators from the United Kingdom will have the same status as all other economic operators based in a third country with which the EU does not have any agreement providing for the opening of the EU procurement market
They shall therefore be subject to the same rules as any third country tenderer.  Article 85 of Directive 2014/25/EU regulating procurement procedures for the purchase of supplies by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors7, sets forth that tenders submitted in the EU may be rejected if the proportion of the products originating in third countries with which the EU has not concluded an agreement ensuring comparable and effective access for EU undertakings to the markets of those third countries, exceeds 50% of the total value of the products constituting the tender. Even where such offers are not rejected, they shall not lead to the award of a contract if there are equivalent offers with less than 50% of the products originating in third countries. Therefore, tenders in this type of EU procurements offering more than 50% of products originating from the United Kingdom and other third countries may be rejected or may not be awarded a contract.  As clarified by Recital 18 of Directive 2009/81/EC regulating procurement procedures by contracting authorities or entities in the field of defence and securit
, EU Member States will retain the power to decide whether or not their contracting authorities/entities may allow economic operators from third countries to participate in their defence and security procurement procedures.
conomic operators from the United Kingdom may therefore be excluded from bidding for defence and security contracts in the EU.  Furthermore, Article 22 of Directive 2009/81/EC provides that Member States shall recognis
the security clearances which they consider equivalent to those issued in accordance with their national law. Since, as of the withdrawal date
the United Kingdom cease
to be
member of the Union, EU Member States will no longer be under the obligation to recognise security clearance
obtained by an economic operator in the United Kingdom
even where they could consider them as equivalent to their national security clearances. This may lead to the exclusion of operators relying on a United Kingdom security clearance in EU defence and security public procurement procedures. The webpage of the Commission on public procurement

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF REGULATED PROFESSIONS AND THE RECOGNITION OF
ROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, all persons who need recognition of their professional qualifications with a view to access a regulated profession are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of recognition of professional qualifications no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences:
Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
For recognition procedures that are ongoing on the withdrawal date, the "Joint report from the negotiators of the European Union and the United Kingdom Government on progress during phase 1 of negotiations under Article 50 TEU on the United Kingdom's orderly withdrawal from the European Union" establishes that, in respect of the persons covered in that report, these recognition procedures will be completed under Union law (paragraph 32): https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/joint-report-negotiators-european-union-and-united-kingdom-government-progress-during-phase

1.
PPLICATION OF EU RULES ON RECOGNITION OF PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS  Professionals seeking to access or pursue a regulated profession in a Member State different from the one where they have obtained their qualifications can rely on Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications
to have their qualifications recognised by that Member State and to pursue their profession there. Directive 2005/36/EC covers EU citizens with qualifications obtained in one or more EU Member States. Under certain conditions and limitations, Directive 2005/36/EC also covers EU citizens with qualifications obtained in third countries
On the contrary, recognition of qualifications of third country nationals, wherever obtained, is not covered by Directive 2005/36/EC
Directive 2005/36/EC also provides for a mechanism allowing professionals established in one Member State to move and provide regulated professional services in another Member State on a temporal or occasional basis (Articles 5 to 9 of Directive 2005/36/EC). Provision of such services may be subject to a prior declaration, if required by the host Member State. It may also involve a prior check of qualifications for a limited number of professions and only if this is necessary to avoid serious damage to the health or safety of the service recipients (Article 7(4) of Directive 2005/36/EC). Other EU rules may provide for the recognition of professional qualifications in relation to specific regulated professions, such as Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts
or Directive 98/5/EC to facilitate practice of the profession of lawyer on a permanent basis in a Member
Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications (OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, p. 22).
6
Articles 2(2), 3(3) and 10(g) of Directive 2005/36/EC
7
A number of other EU Directives may, however, offer some limited recognition possibilities to specific categories of third country nationals, e.g. Directive (EU) 2016/801 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of research, studies, training, voluntary service, pupil exchange schemes or educational projects and au pairing (OJ L 132, 21.5.2016, p. 21), Directive 2014/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the conditions of entry and stay of third-country nationals for the purpose of employment as seasonal workers (OJ L 94, 28.3.2014, p. 375), Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 laying down standards for the reception of applicants for international protection (OJ L 180, 29.6.2013, p. 96). Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection granted (OJ L 337, 20.12.2011, p. 9), Council Directive 2009/50/EC of 25 May 2009 on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment (OJ L 155, 18.6.2009, p. 17), Council Directive 2005/71/EC of 12 October 2005 on a specific procedure for admitting third-country nationals for the purposes of scientific research (OJ L 289, 3.11.2005, p. 15), Council Directive 2003/109/EC of 25 November 2003 concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents (OJ L 16, 23.1.2004, p. 44).
Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).
3 State other than that in which the qualification was obtained
This notice does not deal with the recognition of professional qualifications pursuant to those other rules.10 2.
ECOGNITION
OF PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS RECOGNISED BEFORE THE WITHDRAWAL DATE The withdrawal of the United Kingdom does not affect decisions on the recognition of professional qualifications obtained in the United Kingdom taken before the withdrawal date on the basis of Directive 2005/36/EC by an EU-27 Member State
3.
ECOGNITION
AS OF
HE WITHDRAWAL DATE OF PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS  As of the withdrawal date, United Kingdom nationals will be third country nationals and hence Directive 2005/36/EC no longer applies to them. It follows that:  The recognition of professional qualifications of United Kingdom nationals in an EU-27 Member State will be governed by the national policies and rules of that Member State, irrespective of whether the qualifications of the United Kingdom national were obtained in the United Kingdom, in another third country or in an EU-27 Member State.
The temporary or occasional provision of services by United Kingdom nationals in an EU-27 Member State, even if they are already legally established in an EU-27 Member State will be governed by the national policies and rules of that Member State.  Concerning EU-27 nationals, qualifications obtained in the United Kingdom (hereafter "UK professional qualifications") as of the withdrawal date are third country qualifications for the purpose of EU law. Recognition of such a qualification is no longer covered by the recognition regime of Directive 2005/36/EC
both in respect of EU citizens and of United Kingdom nationals) but, in accordance with Article 2(2) of Directive 2005/36/EC, the recognition will be governed by the national policies and rules of each of the EU-27 Member State

Directive 98/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 to facilitate practice of the profession of lawyer on a permanent basis in a Member State other than that in which the qualification was obtained (OJ L 77, 14.3.1998, p. 36). 10

in an EU-27 Member State.

According to the second indent of Article 3(5) of Commission Directive 2008/43/EC, where a manufacturing site is located outside the EU and the manufacturer is not established in the EU, the importer shall contact the Member State of import in order for the manufacturing site to be attributed a code. As of the withdrawal date, manufacturing sites in the United Kingdom will be identified as located outside the Union and will require a code to be attributed by the national authority of the EU-27 Member State of import. According to Article 3(2) Commission Directive 2008/43/EC, where explosives for civil uses are manufactured in the EU for export, a unique identification mark is not required if the importing third country requires an identification which allows traceability of the explosives. The question whether, as of the withdrawal date, this exception applies for explosives for civil uses manufactured in the EU-27 for export to the United Kingdom will depend on whether the United Kingdom will have, as of the withdrawal date, national identification requirements in place.

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF FERTILISERS The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that unless a ratified withdrawal agreement

2 1.
ESPONSIBILITIES FOR IMPORTERS According to Article 2(x) of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003, a manufacturer is the person responsible for placing a fertiliser on the EU market
The notion covers not only a producer, but also an importer.
According to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003, manufacturers of fertilisers shall be established in the Union, and take responsibility for the conformity of EC fertilisers with that Regulation. The manufacturer is also responsible for providing EC fertilisers with identification markings (Article
of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003), ensuring traceability (Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003), and complying with the specific rules for ammonium nitrate fertilisers of high nitrogen content (Articles 26 and 27 of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003).
As of the withdrawal date, a manufacturer established in the United Kingdom will no longer be an economic operator established in the EU. As a consequence, an economic operator established in the EU-27 and placing EC fertilisers coming from the United Kingdom on the EU-27 market, until then considered as a distributor, will become an EU importer in relation to such products. This operator will therefore have to comply with the above-mentioned obligations for manufacturers.  2.
ARKINGS According to Article 9(1)(a), 11th indent, of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003, packages, labels and accompanying documents of fertilisers shall bear the name or trade name and address of the manufacturer. If, prior to the withdrawal date, the manufacturer was established in the United Kingdom, the marking of the manufacturer on the packages, labels and accompanying documents has to be changed accordingly

The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, economic operators in the field of detergents are reminded of the legal repercussions, which need to considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of detergents, in particular Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on detergents
no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences for detergents placed on the EU market as of the withdrawal date

Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
A third country is a country not member of the EU

In the context of the negotiations of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement, the EU is trying to agree solutions with the United Kingdom concerning goods placed on the EU market before the end of the transition period. See, in particular, the latest text of the draft withdrawal agreement agreed at negotiator's level, which is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_agreement_coloured.pdf

ESPONSIBILITIES FOR IMPORTERS According to Article 2(10) of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004, a manufacturer is the person responsible for placing a detergent or a surfactant for a detergent on the EU market
The notion covers not only a producer, but also an importer. According to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004, manufacturers of detergents or surfactants for detergents shall be established in the Union, and take responsibility for the conformity of detergents or surfactants for detergents with that Regulation.  As of the withdrawal date, a manufacturer established in the United Kingdom will no longer be an economic operator established in the EU. As a consequence, an economic operator established in the EU-27 and placing detergents or surfactants for detergents coming from the United Kingdom on the EU-27 market, until then considered as a distributor, will become an EU importer in relation to such products. This operator will have to comply with the obligations for manufacturer
2.
ABELLING According to Article 11(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004, detergents must be labelled with the name or trademark of the party responsible for placing the product on the market. If, prior to the withdrawal date, the manufacturer was established in the United Kingdom, the marking of the manufacturer on the packages, labels and accompanying documents has to be changed accordingly
3.
PPROVED LABORATORIES Based on Article
3 and 4, as well as Annexes II, III, IV and VIII to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 the following tests are required
Primary biodegradability test
for surfactants in detergents
Ultimate biodegradability (mineralisation) test
for surfactants in detergents
Complementary risk assessment for surfactants in detergents
According to Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004, these tests have to be carried out by laboratories approved by a Member State.
Compliance with this requirement is controlled on products placed on the market.
For detergents placed on the market as of the withdrawal date, tests supporting the safety of detergents according to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 have to have been carried out by a laboratory approved by an EU-27 Member State. The website of the Commission on Chemical Legislation

OTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF COSMETIC PRODUCTS The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Following
request by the United Kingdom, the European Council (Article 50) agreed on 11 April 2019
to extend further
the period provided for in Article 50(3) TEU until 31 October 2019.
This means that the United Kingdom will be, as of 1 November 2019
5 Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the uncertainties surrounding the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement
all interested parties, and especially economic operators, are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Subject to the transition period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement,
as of the withdrawal date the EU rules in the field of cosmetic products, in particular Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30
European Council Decision (EU) 2019/584, OJ L 101, 11.4.2019, p. 1.
Following a request by the United Kingdom, the European Council had decided a first extension on 22 March 2019 (European Council Decision (EU) 2019/476, OJ L 80 I, 22.3.2019, p. 1).
On 11 April 2019, following a second request for an extension by the United Kingdom, the European Council also decided that the decision to extend until 31 October 2019 would cease to apply on 31 May 2019 if the United Kingdom had not held elections to the European Parliament and had not ratified the Withdrawal Agreement by 22 May 2019. As the United Kingdom had not ratified the Withdrawal Agreement by 22 May 2019, it held European elections on 23 May 2019.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
In addition, if the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified by both parties before that date, the withdrawal takes place on the first day of the month following the completion of the ratification procedures.

November 2009 on cosmetic products
no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences for cosmetic products placed on the EU market as of the withdrawal date:  1.
ESPONSIBLE PERSON According to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, only cosmetic products for which a legal or natural person is designated within the EU responsible person shall ensure compliance with the relevant obligations set out in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009
According to Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, for cosmetic products manufactured within the EU, the responsible person shall be the manufacturer established within the EU (by default) or a person who is established within the EU and is designated by written mandate by the manufacturer and has accepted in writing.  According to Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, for cosmetics imported into the EU from a third country, the importer becomes the responsible person (by default) or can designate by written mandate another person to be the responsible person, also
stablished within the EU
who shall accept in writing.  As of the withdrawal date, responsible persons can no longer be established in the United Kingdom. Rather:  If the cosmetic product is manufactured in the United Kingdom, the importer in the EU-27 becomes the responsible person (by default) or can designate by written mandate another person to be the responsible person, also established within the EU, who shall accept in writing.   The same applies if the cosmetic product is manufactured in another third country, imported into the United Kingdom and subsequently imported into the EU-27. Where, currently, a responsible person established in the United Kingdom is designated by an EU-27 manufacturer/importer, that manufacturer/importer should take the necessary measures to ensure that, after the withdrawal date, a responsible person is established in the EU-27 2.
OTIFICATION IN THE COSMETIC PRODUCT NOTIFICATION PORTAL According to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, prior to placing the cosmetic product on the market, the responsible person shall notify a list of information relating to the cosmetic product to the Commission, through the Cosmetic Product Notification Portal
(CPNP

OJ L 342, 22.12.2009, p. 59.
https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/cosmetics/cpnp_en.
3 As of the withdrawal date, prior to placing a cosmetic product on the EU-27 market, the new responsible person in the EU-27 will have to make product notifications in the CPNP.  As regards existing notifications made before the withdrawal date by a responsible person established in the United Kingdom, the CPNP offers the possibility to transfer notifications to another responsible person. Thus, a UK-based responsible person can transfer an existing notification to the future EU-27 responsible person. This EU-27 responsible person will then be able to edit the notification and complete it by adding its own required information, such as the name and address of the responsible person (point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009), and the new labelling (Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009; see also the section 4 of this notice). However, this transfer in CPNP is only possible until the withdrawal date. As of the withdrawal date, the former UK-based responsible person will no longer have access to the CPNP.
ew responsible persons established in the EU-27 can already indicate before the withdrawal date that cosmetic products manufactured in the United Kingdom will be, as of the withdrawal date, imported into the Union from the United Kingdom as a country of origin.  3.
RODUCT INFORMATION FILE (PIF) According to Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, when a cosmetic product is placed on the market, the responsible person shall keep a product information file (PIF
for the cosmetic product for a period of ten years.  The PIF shall be readily accessible in electronic or other format at the address of the responsible person, as indicated on the label of the cosmetic product
to the competent authority of the Member State in which the PIF is kept. The information in the PIF shall be available in a language that can be easily understood by the competent authority of the Member State. As of the withdrawal date, the PIF has to be made available at the address of the responsible person in the EU-27 and adapted in terms of the language requirements of the Member State in question.
4.
ABELLING According to Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, the name and address of the responsible person shall be indicated on the label of cosmetic products. The country of origin shall be specified for imported cosmetic products. As of the withdrawal date, cosmetic products manufactured in the United Kingdom and placed on the EU market will be a cosmetic product imported into the EU-27 from a third country
The country of origin will need to be specified for these imported cosmetic products.

5.
AFETY ASSESSOR
ccording to Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, the responsible person shall, prior to placing a cosmetic product on the market, ensure that the cosmetic product has undergone a safety assessment on the basis of the relevant information and that a cosmetic product safety report is drawn up in accordance with Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and the related Guidelines laid down in Commission Implementing Decision 2013/674/EU of 25 November 2013.10 The cosmetic product safety report is included in the PIF
Pursuant to Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, the cosmetic product safety assessment be carried out by a person in possession of a diploma or other evidence of formal qualifications awarded on completion of a university course of theoretical and practical study in pharmacy, toxicology, medicine or a similar discipline, or a course recognised as equivalent by a Member State.
Section 4.4 of the Guidelines on Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 requires needed, proof of equivalence) to be provided with the cosmetic product safety report.
As of the withdrawal date, qualifications from the United Kingdom which have not been recognised as equivalent by an EU-27 Member State can no longer be relied on for the purpose of fulfilling the requirements of Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009. It follows that:   for a cosmetic product placed on the Union (EU-27) market prior to the withdrawal date: cosmetic product safety assessments carried out and safety reports drawn up prior to the withdrawal date by a safety assessor holding qualifications from the United Kingdom will remain valid.   for any cosmetic product placed on the Union (EU-27) market as of the withdrawal date: the cosmetic product safety assessment must have been carried out and the safety report drawn up by a safety assessor who, on the date of placing on the market, fulfils the requirements of Article 10(2) of Regulation No 1223/2009, i.e. holds the necessary qualifications from an EU-27 Member State.
Safety assessors currently holding qualifications from the United Kingdom are therefore advised to seek, before the withdrawal date, recognition of equivalence from an EU-27 Member State in order for their credentials to remain compliant with the requirements of Article 10(2) of Regulation No 1223/2009

SSIGNMENT OF THE UNIQUE CODE OF THE MANUFACTURER
ENERAL REQUIREMENTS Point 2.1 of Part A of Annex I to Directive 2013/53/EU requires each watercraft to unique code of the manufacturer assigned by the national authority of the Member State Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1 of 3 January 2017 on procedures for watercraft identification
provides that the unique code of the manufacturer is assigned by Member State authorities or authorised national bodies.
Manufacturers established in a Member State shall apply for the assignment of the unique code to the national authority or national body in the Member State in which they are established.
Manufacturers established in a third country shall apply to the national authority or national body in the Member State in which they intend to place the watercraft on the market. The application shall be made only in one Member State.
Watercraft placed on the Union (EU-27) market before the withdrawal date with a UK-granted unique code of the manufacturer can continue to be made available in the EU-27 market or remain in use after the withdrawal date.  However, it will no longer be possible to place on the market watercraft bearing a UK-granted unique code of the manufacturer as of the withdrawal date. The manufacturers concerned should therefore obtain a new unique code from an EU-27 Member State. 1.1.
onsequences for manufacturers established in the UK with the unique code of the manufacturer assigned by the UK authorities
anufacturers established in the UK who currently have the unique code of the manufacturer assigned by the UK authorities and who intend to place their products on the EU-27 market as of the withdrawal date will be considered as manufacturers established in a third country. They will therefore have to apply for the assignment of a new unique code of the manufacturer to the

ECOGNITION OF TESTS OF CHEMICAL PRODUCTS According to Article 5(1) of Directive 2004/10/EC, Member States may not, on grounds relating to good laboratory practice (GLP), prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market of chemical products if the tests on the chemical product were performed in another Member State. As of the withdrawal date, this principle of mutual recognition set out in EU law no longer applies to the tests that were conducted in the United Kingdom. auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will apply as of the withdrawal date.
All Member States participating in the MAD system must accept data from OECD members
which are full adherents to the MAD system having passed a successful evaluation by OECD under the OECD GLP Compliance Monitoring Programme
The United Kingdom is an OECD member and a full adherent to the MAD system, as are Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain
France, Italy, Hungary, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden. Thus, the mutual acceptance under the MAD system will apply, as of the withdrawal date, between the United Kingdom and these EU Member States.  The mutual acceptance under the MAD system in relation to the United Kingdom does not apply to EU Member States which are:  participating in the OECD GLP Compliance Monitoring Programme, but have not yet been successfully evaluated (Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg). While these EU Member States would have to accept data from the United Kingdom under the MAD system, the United Kingdom would not have to accept data from them; or  not participating in the OECD GLP Compliance Monitoring Programme

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF INDUSTRIAL SECURITY The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that, unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties. In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, candidates or tenderers, contractors or subcontractors (in the case of classified contracts) and applicants and beneficiaries (in the case of classified grant agreements) are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Please note that this notice does not address: a) access to procurement by natural and legal persons established in a third country, as set out in Article 119 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union;
and b) restrictions on access to procurement as provided for in EU legislation to protect the essential interests of the security of the EU or public security.

Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU. OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1.
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement,
as of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom's status with regard to the rules on industrial security
for procurement procedures, classified contracts and classified grant procedures/classified grant agreements with the Commission and other institutions and bodies applying Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 of 13 March 2015 on the security rules for protecting EU classified information changes. This has in particular the following consequences:7 8 1.
ACILITY SECURITY CLEARANCE (FSC) According to Article 44(3) of Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444, where EU classified information has to be provided in the course of the procurement or grant award procedure, a facility security clearance is required. According to Article 44(4) of Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444, the contracting or granting authority shall not award a classified contract or grant agreement before having received confirmation about issuance of a facility security clearance by the National Security Authority (NSA), the Designated Security Authority (DSA) or any other competent security authority of the Member State in which the contractor, subcontractor, or beneficiary is registered. As of the withdrawal date, facility security clearances issued by the United Kingdom NSA, DSA or other competent security authority are no longer valid for the purposes of Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444. This could, under the terms of the classified contract/grant agreement that was signed, constitute a ground for termination, unless the contractor/beneficiary has taken appropriate remedial measures, such as the assignment of the contract to an economic operator or, in the case of a consortium being granted the contract, the rearrangement of action tasks within that consortium to a participant which holds, as from the withdrawal date, a facility security clearance

The arrangements contained in the draft withdrawal agreement, which includes a transition period,
agreed at negotiator's level between the EU and the UK and published on 19 March 2018, provide, in Article 122(7)(b) for specific rules on the access to certain security related sensitive information during the transition period
https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_agreement_coloured.pdf). The text of the withdrawal agreement, however, still needs to be fully agreed and ratified.

Similar rules have been adopted by other institutions and bodies, cf. in particular Council Decision 2013/488/EU of 23 September 2013 on the security rules for protecting EU classified information (OJ L 274, 15.10.2013, p. 1) and Decision of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of 19 September 2017 on the security rules for the European External Action Service (OJ C 126, 10.04.2018, p. 1).

ERSONNEL SECURITY CLEARANCE (PSC) Article 43 of Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 provides that classified contracts or classified grant agreements shall include provisions indicating that staff of a contractor, subcontractor or beneficiary who, for the performance of the classified contract, subcontract or grant agreement, require access to EU classified information, shall be security cleared at the relevant level by the NSA, DSA or any other competent authority of the Member State in which the contractor, subcontractor, or beneficiary is registered. According to Article 44(3) of Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444, where EU classified information has to be provided in the course of the procurement or grant procedure, a personnel security clearance is required. As of the withdrawal date, the personnel security clearances issued by the United Kingdom NSA, DSA or other competent security authority are no longer valid for the purposes of Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444. This could, under the terms of the classified contract/grant agreement that was signed, constitute a ground for termination, unless the contractor/ beneficiary has taken appropriate remedial measures, such as ensuring that the staff concerned holds, as from the withdrawal date, a personnel security clearance  issued by an EU-27 Member State; or  issued by a third country with which a security of information agreement covering industrial security aspects has been concluded, which provides for the recognition of a personnel security clearance. Where an award procedure is ongoing on the withdrawal date, tenderers or applicants that cannot comply with their security obligations will be rejected. 3.
UBCONTRACTS It is recalled that, according to Article 46(2) and (3) of Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444, the contractor or beneficiary shall obtain permission from the contracting authority, before sub-contracting any parts of a classified contract or grant agreement, and shall not provide EU classified information to a sub-contractor without the prior written consent of the contracting authority. No subcontract involving access to EU classified information may be awarded to subcontractors registered in a third country, unless there is a particular regulatory framework for the
security of information. Non-compliance with this obligation could, under the terms of the classified contract/grant agreement that was signed, constitute a ground for termination, unless the contractor/beneficiary has taken appropriate remedial measures (such as ensuring that the subcontract is changed to a subcontractor with security clearance issued by an EU-27 Member State or third country with a security agreement). Where an award procedure is ongoing on the withdrawal date, tenderers or applicants with subcontracts that do not comply with the security requirements will be rejected.

OTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM FROM THE UNION AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF DATA PROTECTION The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, all stakeholders processing personal data are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules for transfer of personal data to third countries apply. Aside from an "adequacy decision", which allows the free flow of personal data from the EU without the EU data exporter having to implement any additional safeguards or being subject to further conditions, the EUrules (both under the current Directive 95/46 and under the new General Data Protection
which will apply as from 25 May 2018) allow a transfer if the controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards. These safeguards may be provided for by

Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU
4
For the continued application of EU safeguards of personal data processed while the United Kingdom was a Member State, the Commission has published an essential principles paper here
https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/position-paper-use-data-and-protection-information-obtained-or-processed-withdrawal-date_en

Standard data protection clauses: the Commission has adopted three sets of model clauses which are available o
Binding corporate rules: legally binding data protection rules approved by the competent data protection authority which apply within a corporate group;  Approved Codes of Conduct together with binding and enforceable commitments of the controller or processor in the third country
Approved certification mechanisms together with binding and enforceable commitments of the controller or processor in the third country
In the absence of an adequacy decision or of appropriate safeguards a transfer or a set of transfers may take place on the basis of s
called
they allow transfers in specific cases, such as based on consent, for the performance of a contract, for the exercise of legal claims or for important reasons of public interest
These tools are well-known to business operators in the Member States, as they are already being used today for the transfers of personal data to non-EU countries.  The GDPR has simplified the use of these tools by cutting red tape compared to the current Directive 95/46. Transfers based on approved standard data protection clauses or on binding corporate rules will not be subject to a further, specific authorisation from a supervisory authority. In addition, the GDPR has, subject to further conditions, introduced codes of conduct and certification mechanisms as new tools for the transfer of personal data. Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties. As regards the implementation of the GDPR
and in particular the new tools for transfers to third countries (e.g. approved Codes of Conduct and approved certification mechanisms entailing binding commitments by the controllers and processors receiving the data in the third country), the Commission (DG JUST) is working with interested parties and data protection authorities to make the best use of these new instruments. Moreover, the Commission has set up a stakeholder group comprised of industry, civil society and academics, in which this topic will be discussed.

OTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES ON COMPANY LAW The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Following
request by the United Kingdom, the European Council (Article 50) agreed on 11 April 2019
to extend further
the period provided for in Article 50(3) TEU until 31 October 2019.
This means that the United Kingdom will be, as of 1 November 2019 a third country

Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties. In view of the uncertainties surrounding the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement
all interested parties, and especially economic operators, are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country

European Council Decision (EU) 2019/584, OJ L 101, 11.4.2019, p. 1.
Following a request by the United Kingdom, the European Council had decided a first extension on 22 March 2019 (European Council Decision (EU) 2019/476, OJ L 80 I, 22.3.2019, p. 1).
On 11 April 2019, following a second request for an extension by the United Kingdom, the European Council also decided that the decision to extend until 31 October 2019 would cease to apply on 31 May 2019 if the United Kingdom had not held elections to the European Parliament and had not ratified the Withdrawal Agreement by 22 May 2019. As the United Kingdom had not ratified the Withdrawal Agreement by 22 May 2019, it held European elections on 23 May 2019.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
In addition, if the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified by both parties before that date, the withdrawal takes place on the first day of the month following the completion of the ratification procedures.

Subject to the transition period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement,
as of the withdrawal date the EU rules in the field of company law no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences
Please note: This notice does not address

EU antitrust law and EU merger law (please note that the withdrawal of the United Kingdom has no impact on the applicability of EU antitrust rules and EU merger control rules if the jurisdictional criteria are fulfilled);

European international insolvency law.

OMPANIES INCORPORATED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM The freedom of establishment, set out in Article 54 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) ensures inter alia the recognition, throughout the Union, of a company incorporated in one Member State.  As of the withdrawal date, companies incorporated in the United Kingdom will be third country companies and therefore not automatically be recognised under Article 54 TFEU by the Member States (in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice). Member States will not be obliged to recognise the legal personality (and thus the limited liability
of companies, which are incorporated in the United Kingdom, but have the central administration or the principal place of business in the EU-27 Member States
UK incorporated companies may be recognised in accordance with each Member State's national law (private international law rules concerning companies and the subsequently applicable substantive company law), or international treaties. As a consequence, depending on the applicable national or international law rules, such companies might not have a legal standing in the EU and shareholders might be personally liable for the debts of the company.  Where branches of a UK incorporated company are located in EU-27 Member States, they will be branches of third country companies and accordingly the rules relevant to branches of third country companies will apply

Directive (EU) 2017/1132 applies to limited liability companies incorporated in accordance with national laws of the Member States. As of the withdrawal date, these rules no longer apply to the United Kingdom. Consequently, stakeholders, including employees, creditors and investors dealing with UK companies cannot rely on these EU rules. This means that, for example, EU rules on compulsory disclosure of certain company information in the business registers (such as documents and particulars related to instruments of constitution, appointment, termination of office and particulars of person
representing a company, the winding-up of a company or a change of the registered office) will no longer apply with regard to UK companies
3.
ROSS-BORDER MERGERS Directive (EU) 2017/1132 also provides for procedural rules for cross border mergers of limited liability companies. These rules apply to limited liability companies governed by national laws of the Member States and listed in Annex I to that Directive.13
As of the withdrawal date, these rules no longer apply to the United Kingdom.14 Where a cross border merger involving a company incorporated in the United Kingdom is pending on the withdrawal date, (national) rules for mergers with companies established in third countries apply to the merger as of the withdrawal date. 4. SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND ENGAGEMENT Directive 2007/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on the exercise of certain rights of shareholders in listed companies15 provide
for rules in relation to the exercise of certain shareholder rights, transparency obligations, and share-ownership responsibilities (i.e. monitoring of the investee company, voting, etc.). Directive 2007/36/EC applies to companies which have their registered office in a Member State and the shares of which are admitted to trading on a regulated market situated or operating within a Member State.16 As of the withdrawal date, the EU rules on shareholder rights and engagement no longer apply to companies which have their registered office in the United Kingdom or which are only listed on a stock exchange in the United Kingdom.                                                  11

They provide for recommendations regarding the independence of board members from the company and the controlling shareholder, the creation of board committees on nomination, remuneration and audit and regarding remuneration of directors in listed companies. The recommendations apply to companies listed on EU regulated markets.19 As of the withdrawal date, these recommendations no longer apply to UK companies or to companies which are (only

AKEOVER BIDS Directive 2004/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on takeover bids20 sets rules for takeover bids where all or some of the securities are traded on a regulated market in one or more Member States.21 As of the withdrawal date, where the securities are traded in the United Kingdom, this Directive no longer applies. Where a takeover bid is pending on the withdrawal date, national rules for takeover bid will apply as of the withdrawal date. 6.
USINESS REGISTERS INTERCONNECTION SYSTEM (BRIS) business registers are interconnected via a European central platform22 through the business registers interconnection system (BRIS) and publicly accessible through the European e-Justice Portal.23 As of the withdrawal date, information in the United Kingdom company register is no longer exchanged via BRIS
or accessible through the European
Justice Portal.  According to Articles 36 and 37 of Directive (EU) 2017/1132, Member States business registers have to provide certain information in relation to companies in a third country (e.g. changes to the companies in a third country with a branch in EU-27; mergers involving at least one EU company and one third country company). However, this information is not exchanged with other Member States through BRIS. Thus, as of the withdrawal date, while EU-27 Member States business registers will provide some information in relation to companies in the United Kingdom, this information is not part of the information exchange through BRIS

The European Compan

The recognition of such companies by an EU-27 Member State would only be possible on the same basis as other UK incorporated companies (see above, section 1 of this notice).
According to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001, SEs can be created by companies or other legal bodies formed in an EU Member State, with their registered and head offices within the EU
As of the withdrawal date, the UK incorporated companies will not be able to participate in the formation of an SE. SEs that have their registered office in the EU-27 at the time of withdrawal will preserve their legal status, even if they were formed, before the withdrawal date, by
UK company. The same applies with regard to subsidiary SEs.26
The European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG)27 has to be regist
ed in an EU Member State.28 As of the withdrawal date, EEIGs registered in the United Kingdom no longer enjoy the status of an EEIG.
According to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2137/85, EEIGs can consist only of companies or other legal bodies formed in an EU Member State, with their registered or statutory office and central administration in the EU, or of natural persons carrying out services in the EU. Where UK incorporated companies or other UK legal bodies are members of an EEIG, and where natural persons carry out services only in the United Kingdom, these will cease to belong to an EEIG as of the withdrawal date
The European Cooperative Society (SCE)29 has to be set up within the territory of the EU30 and the registered office has to be in the same EU Member State as the head office.31 As of the withdrawal date, SCEs registered in the United Kingdom will no longer enjoy the status of an SCE.

OTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF CIVIL JUSTICE AND PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that as from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET)
the United Kingdom will be a third country
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the uncertainties surrounding the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, all interested parties are reminded of legal repercussions which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to the transition period provided for in the draft Withdrawal Agreement,
as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of civil justice and private international law no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences:


n accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
Cf. Part four of the draft Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Bri
in and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, as agreed at negotiator's level on 14 November 2018 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/draft-agreement-withdrawal-uk-eu-agreed-negotiators-level-14-november-2018-including-text-article-132_en)
It is recalled that the United Kingdom does not participate in the full acquis of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters.
2 1.
NTERNATIONAL JURISDICTION EU private international law establishes harmonised rules for international jurisdiction in areas of civil and commercial matters, incl. insolvency, and family law.
Broadly speaking these harmonised rules apply only where a defendant is domiciled or resident in an EU Member State. 1.1. Proceedings pending on the withdrawal date For proceedings involving a defendant domiciled in the United Kingdom, and pending with a court of the EU-27 Member States
on the withdrawal date, the EU rules for international jurisdiction continue to apply
1.2. Proceedings initiated as of the withdrawal date For proceedings involving
United Kingdom domiciled defendant initiated on or after the withdrawal date in the EU-27 Member States, the rules on international jurisdiction in EU instruments in the area of civil and commercial law as well as family law no longer apply, unless the EU instruments set the rules of jurisdiction with regard to third countries.
International jurisdiction will thus be governed by the national rules of the Member State in which a court has been seized
In some instances, international conventions, such as the conventions developed by the Hague Conference on Private International Law apply8, provided that both the EU/EU Member States and the United Kingdom are parties to the convention. 2.
ECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMEN
EU private international law sets rules for the facilitated recognition and enforcement of judicial decisions issued by a Member State. 2.1. Exequatured judgements
here the relevant instrument foresees exequatur, if a judgment of a UK court has been exequatured in the EU-27 before the withdrawal date but not yet enforced before that date, the judgment can still be enforced in the EU-27,
This notice does not address specifically consumer protection issues. See, for these aspects, the "Notice to stakeholders
Withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules on consumer protection and passenger rights", published on 27 February 2018.
While the EU Treaties provide for specific arrangements for the (non)participation of Ireland and Denmark in this part of the EU acquis
for the sake of simplicity, the notion "EU-27" is used.
This is, for example, the case with regard to litigation involving consumers (see footnote 5).
Usually, these conventions are transposed into national law of each State that is party to the Convention.
3 and the fact that it was originally a judgment handed down by UK courts is irrelevant. 2.2. Proceedings pending on the withdrawal date Unless a judgment of a UK court has been exequatured before the withdrawal date, the EU rules on recognition and enforcement of such judgments of UK will not apply to a judgment of a UK court that has not been enforced before the withdrawal date, even where  the judgment was handed down before the withdrawal date
or   the enforcement proceedings were commenced before the withdrawal date. 2.3. Proceedings initiated on or after the withdrawal date For proceedings to enforce a judgment of a UK court that are commenced as of the withdrawal date in the EU
7, EU rules no longer apply. Recognition and enforcement will be governed by the national rules of the Member State in which recognition/enforcement is sought. In some instances, international conventions, such as the conventions developed by the Hague Conference on Private International Law apply9, provided that both, the EU/EU Member States and the United Kingdom are parties to the convention. All stakeholders are advised to take this into consideration when assessing contractual choices of international jurisdiction  3.
PECIFIC EU PROCEDURES EU law on judicial cooperation in civil matters provides for several specific procedures, such as the European Payment Order Procedure10 or the European Procedure for Small Claims.11 The approach to jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement in sections 1 and 2 of this notice also applies for these specific judicial procedures.
Usually, these conventions are transposed into national law of each State that is party to the Convention. 10

UDICIAL COOPERATION PROCEDURES BETWEEN MEMBER STATES EU law on judicial cooperation in civil matters provides for facilitated judicial cooperation (e.g. in relation to the service of documents12, taking of evidence13 or within the context of the European Judicial Network in Civil and Commercial Matters14). As of the withdrawal date, EU-27 Member States
o not proceed further such pending judicial cooperation procedures involving the United Kingdom
and  do not launch new such judicial cooperation procedures involving the United Kingdom on the basis of EU law.
uch procedures may continue to be processed according to national law on judicial cooperation with third countries. In some instances, international conventions, such as the conventions developed by the Hague Conference on Private International Law apply15, provided that both, the EU/EU Member States and the United Kingdom are parties to the convention.16 All national Central Authorities are advised to assess whether judicial cooperation procedures risk being pending on the withdrawal date and whether the procedure can continue under national law or a relevant international convention. Where this continuation under national law or a relevant international convention is possible, the Central Authority should consider submitting an additional request under the relevant national law/international convention which would be conditional upon the United Kingdom withdrawing from the Union without withdrawal agreement.                                                  12

Usually, these conventions are transposed into national law of each State that is party to the Convention. 16
For example, concerning international child abductions, the application from the requesting Central Authority can be examined by the requested Central Authority under the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction instead.
5 5.
THER ISSUES  Regulation (EU) 2016/119117 abolishes for certain public documents (for example, a birth certificate) the apostille requirement and simplifies other formalities thereby facilitating the circulation of certain public documents. The application of Regulation (EU) 2016/1191 does not depend on the date of issue of the public document but on the date when it is presented to the authorities of another Member State. Hence, Regulation (EU) 2016/1191 will no longer apply to a public document issued by the UK authorities which is presented to the authorities of a Member State of the EU-27 as from the withdrawal date, regardless of the date of issuance and the period of validity of the public document issued by the UK authorities.  The Commission provides a series of information tools on national judicial system through the e-Justice portal.18 As of the withdrawal date, the
Justice Portal will no longer provide information related to the United Kingdom, including the dynamic forms and the UK factsheets.  The European e-Justice Portal https://beta.e-justice.europa.eu/?action=home&plang=e
and the website of the Commission on civil justice http://ec.europa.eu/justice/civil/index_en.htm provide for information concerning the field of civil justice. These pages will be updated with further information, where necessary.

The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. After a first extension decided on 22 March 2019, the European Council (Article 50) decided on 11 April 2019, in agreement with the United Kingdom, to further extend the 2-year period provided for in Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union until 31 October 2019.
However, in the event that the United Kingdom does not hold elections to the European Parliament and has not ratified the Withdrawal Agreement by 22 May 2019, the withdrawal date is 1 June 2019

While the EU Treaties provide for specific arrangements for the (non)participation of Ireland and Denmark in this part of the EU acquis
for the sake of simplicity, the notion "EU-27" is used.
2 Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters
sets out the rules for international jurisdiction in matters relating to insurance. These rules establish jurisdiction of EU courts where the insurer is domiciled in a Member State.
This means that as of the withdrawal date
the possibility to sue the UK insurer in the court of an EU Member State depend
on national law of that EU Member State.  Proceedings pending on the withdrawal date in the EU-27 Member States For issues of international jurisdiction in proceedings pending on the withdrawal date, please refer to the Brexit preparedness notice.

PPLICABLE LAW
What will be the law applicable to consumer contracts as from the 2.1.withdrawal date? Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I)
ensures that, irrespective of the law chosen by the parties or which applies by default, consumers with a habitual place of residence in a
EU Member State enjoy the mandatory protection of that law if they are targeted there by third country traders. As of the withdrawal date, this will apply also in relation to UK traders.
3.
ECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT
Can a UK judgment still be recognised and enforced under EU rules 3.1.as of the withdrawal date?  This matter is addressed in the Brexit preparedness notice:
he EU rules on recognition and enforcement will not apply to a judgment of a UK court, even where the judgment was handed down before the withdrawal date or the enforcement proceedings were commenced before the withdrawal date
The only exception to this rule is if a judgment of a UK court has been exequatured before the withdrawal date. The reason for this is that such a judgment has already been declared enforceable in a specific EU Member State by the courts of that Member State before the withdrawal date. Thus, the fact that the judgment was originally handed down by a UK court has become irrelevant. This exception applies also to authentic instruments and agreements, which have been declared enforceable in an EU-27 Member State before the withdrawal date.
What if a certificate has been issued under Regulation (EU) No 3.2.1215/2012 before the withdrawal date?  The rule set out in section 3.1. of this Q&A document
i.e. that enforcement under EU law stops
also applies to
he issuance of a certificate in the Member State of origin in accordance with Article 53 of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012.  The issuance of such a certificate in the Member State of origin cannot be compared to a declaration of enforceability ('exequatur') in the Member State of enforcement prior to the withdrawal date. The Member State can decide under national law to continue to apply essentially the same rules as the current ones to a UK judgment for which a

certificate under Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 has been issued before the withdrawal date.
What about recognition and enforcement of a UK judgment given by 3.3.a court designated in a choice of court agreement?
Proceedings initiated as from the withdrawal date in the EU Member States On 28 December 2018 the United Kingdom signed and ratified the 2005 Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements.10 It will apply to the United Kingdom when the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without a withdrawal agreement.  However, according to Article 16(1) of the Convention, it will only apply to exclusive choice of court agreements concluded after its entry into force for the United Kingdom, i.e. after the United Kingdom has become party to the Convention.11
Proceedings pending on the withdrawal date in the EU Member States For issues of proceedings pending on the withdrawal date, please refer to the Brexit preparedness notice.
What about recognition of a UK divorce judgment? 3.4.UK divorce judgment handed down before the withdrawal date, but not subject to a recognition proceeding under Article 21(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility.12 A divorce judgment, which has already taken effect before the withdrawal date
will not lose its validity as from the withdrawal date. Such a judgment changes the status of the spouses from married to divorced, which is presumed to be the same in all EU-27 Member States. If the change of status occurred before the withdrawal date, it remains valid in all EU-27 Member States unless and until there is a court decision on non-recognition. The fact that the legal regime subsequently changes will not deprive such a status decision of its effect. However, if a divorce judgment is challenged in the EU as from the withdrawal date, EU rules on grounds of non-recognition of a divorce judgment will no longer apply, but grounds of non-recognition are subject to national law.                                                  10

The United Kingdom is party to this Convention, but currently only 12 EU-27 Member States are contracting parties.

What about recognition and enforcement of a UK maintenance 3.5.decision? Proceedings initiated as from the withdrawal date in the EU-27 Member States The 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance14
deals with the matter at the international level. On 28 December 2018 the United Kingdom signed and ratified this Convention. It will apply to the United Kingdom when the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without a withdrawal agreement. However, according to Article 56(1) of the Convention, it will only apply to requests and applications made after the United Kingdom has become party to the Convention.15 Proceedings pending on the withdrawal date in the EU-27 Member States For issues of proceedings pending on the withdrawal date, please refer to the Brexit preparedness notice: For proceedings conducted before the courts of the EU Member States on the withdrawal date and involving a party domiciled in the United Kingdom
the provisions on recognition and enforcement under the EU law cease to apply as from the withdrawal date. These specific provisions are applicable only in cross-border cases as defined in the Regulation, i.e. where the recognition or enforcement of a maintenance decision originating from one Member State is sought in another Member State. As from the withdrawal date, this requirement will no longer be met for parties with domicile or habitual residence in the United Kingdom. It will then be for the EU-27 Member States to decide how to deal with the case in the procedural terms: whether they will continue in accordance with the national                                                  13

EU-27 Member States continue to apply Regulation (EU) 2015/848, taking account of the United Kingdom as a third country to which Regulation (EU) 2015/848 does not apply. Main or secondary proceedings pending on the withdrawal date in an EU-27 Member State Section 1. of the Brexit preparedness notice also applies to insolvency proceedings. The EU rules on jurisdiction continue to apply. Where prior to the withdrawal date main proceedings were opened in the United Kingdom and secondary proceedings were opened in EU-27 Member State(s)
the courts of Member State(s) in question retain international jurisdiction according to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings.16
What happens in case of insolvency proceedings opened in the 4.2.United Kingdom before the withdrawal date?  Section 2. of the Brexit preparedness notice also applies to insolvency proceedings:

Procedures initiated as from the withdrawal date in the EU-27 Member States For procedures involving a UK domiciled defendant initiated on or after the withdrawal date in the EU Member States, the EU-specific procedures will no longer be available
Procedures pending on the withdrawal date in the EU-27 Member States The European Payment Order Procedure and the European Procedure for Small Claims are available only in cross-border cases as defined in the relevant Regulations, i.e. where at least one party has a domicile or habitual residence in a Member State other than the one of the court seized.19 Procedures conducted before the courts of the EU-27 Member States on the withdrawal date and involving a party domiciled in the United Kingdom cease under the EU law as from the withdrawal date. It is for each EU-27 Member State to decide whether, on the basis of national procedural law

OTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU
ULES ON CONSUMER PROTECTION AND PASSENGER RIGHTS The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, stakeholders concerned are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the general EU rules in the field of consumer law (such as the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive4, the Consumer Rights Directive5, the
Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.

This has in particular the following consequences: 1.
URCHASE BY CONSUMERS IN THE EU OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM TRADERS ESTABLISHED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM10 On or after the withdrawal date, consumers in the EU might purchase products or services from traders established in the United Kingdom. According to EU law, where a consumer concludes a contract with a professional in another country who, by any means, direct
his commercial activities to the consumer's country of residence, the contract is generally governed by the law of the country where the consumer has his or her habitual residence. It is possible to choose another law but that choice cannot deprive the consumer of the protection afforded by the law of the habitual residence which cannot be derogated from by agreement under that law.11 On that basis EU courts will continue to apply the EU rules on consumer protection even though the trader is in the United Kingdom. This includes in particular the rules set out in:
he Unfair Commercial Practices Directive;12  the Consumer Rights Directive;13

This means that, as from the withdrawal date, United Kingdom authorities will not be obliged under EU law to cooperate in the case of cross-border claims.  In addition, as of the withdrawal date
EU law giving to certain "qualified entities", designated by EU Member States, legal standing for bringing injunction actions in another Member State no longer applies to the United Kingdom.25 2.

also must provide such insolvency protection in each of the Member State
they are selling to.27 However, where an organiser established in a third country does not offer travel package
to consumers in the EU and does not direct its selling activities to the EU (passive sales), EU law providing mandatory insolvency protection does not appl
This means that in such cases insolvency protection granted by EU law will not apply to insolvencies of organisers established in the United Kingdom occurring as of the withdrawal date.

s of the withdrawal date, EU law providing for the mutual recognition of insolvency protection taken out in accordance with the requirements of the home country of an organiser no longer applies with regard to insolvency protection taken out in accordance with requirements applicable in the United Kingdom.28 This means that, as of the withdrawal date, insolvency protection taken out in the United Kingdom no longer serves to comply with the requirements for insolvency protection of package travel organisers in accordance with Article 17 of Directive (EU) 2015/2302.                                                  24

EU PASSENGER RIGHTS  Air passengers: As of the withdrawal date, EU law on air passenger rights29 no longer applies to passengers departing from an airport located in the United Kingdom to an airport situated in the territory of a EU-27 Member State, unless the operating air carrier of the flight concerned is a Union carrier, i.e. has an operating licence granted by an EU-27 Member State. This means that, despite the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU
air passenger rights granted by EU law continue to apply to passengers departing from the United Kingdom to an airport situated in the territory of an EU-27 Member State with a Community carrier. However, air passenger rights granted by EU law do not apply to flights departing as of the withdrawal date from the United Kingdom to the EU-27 with non-Community carriers
EU law granting specific rights for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility travelling by air30 will no longer apply to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility using commercial passenger air services who, as of the withdrawal date, depart from, transit through, or arrive at an airport in the United Kingdom. However, certain rights, such as assistance by air carriers, continue to apply to air passengers departing from an UK airport to an EU-27 airport if the operating carrier is a Community air carrier.31
Ship passengers: EU law on ship passenger rights32 continues to apply on and after the withdrawal date to passengers where the port of embarkation is in the EU-2733 or in the United Kingdom, provided that the port of disembarkation is in the EU-27 and the service is operated by a carrier established within the territory of a Member State or offering passenger transport services to or from a Member State ("Union carrier").34

Brussels, 9 April 2018
OTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES ON FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that, unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, operators carrying out fishing activities and any of the activities related to any stage of production, processing, marketing, distribution and retail chains of fishery and aquaculture products are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the Common fisheries policy rules no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences:
1.
ONTROL AND ENFORCEMENT In accordance with international law of the sea, fishing vessels wishing to engage in fishing activities in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a third country are
Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
This notice does not address aspects related to maritime transport, including safety of fishing vessels (see, for these aspects, the "Notice to stakeholders
Withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in the field of maritime transport"), seafarer qualifications (see, for these aspects
the "Notice to stakeholders
Withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules on the minimum level of training of seafarers and the mutual recognition of seafarers' certificates"), and marine equipment (see, for these aspects, the "Notice to stakeholders
Withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in the field of industrial products
(https://ec.europa.eu/info/brexit/brexit-preparedness_en).
required to obtain a fishing authorisation from that third country. In addition, fishing vessels performing fishing activities in third country waters are subject to applicable laws and regulations of the concerned coastal state and hence may undergo control and enforcement activities carried out by the authorities of the coastal state concerned. The flag State is responsible for diligently monitoring, including through authorisation schemes, the activities of vessels flying its flag when operating in third country waters, to ensure that such activities do not undermine the sustainability of the stocks in the coastal state's waters and are consistent with applicable conservation rules of the coastal state. Against this background,
ccess by Union vessels to third country waters under direct authorisations
granted by the third country authorities
fall under the authorisation procedure foreseen by Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets
In this framework, provided that all criteria and conditions foreseen in Articles 4 to 7 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2403
re complied with, EU Member States may authorise their vessels to fish under such direct authorisations in accordance with the procedure set out in Articles 16 to 18 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2403. This procedure requires the prior notification of the Commission and gives the Commission the possibility to object to the granting of the fishing authorisation in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 if the conditions set out therein are not complied with.
As of the withdrawal date, these rules will apply to Union fishing vessels wishing to engage in fishing activities in waters of the United Kingdom. Access by third country vessels to Union waters is subject to the authorisation procedure foreseen in Title III of Regulation (EU) 2017/2403. In this regard, third country vessels may only engage in fishing activities in Union waters if in possession of an authorisation issued by the European Commission in accordance with Articles 32 to 34 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 and provided they comply with the other requirements in that Title, notably Article 38 of Council Regulation (EU) 2017/2403, which sets the rules on control and enforcement measures for fishing activities within Union waters of fishing vessels flying the flag of a third country.
As of the withdrawal date, these rules will apply to United Kingdom fishing vessels wishing to engage in fishing activities in Union waters
2.
ANDINGS AND FIRST SALE OF FISHERY PRODUCTS Access to ports of third countries, including port services and first-stage marketing installations, and the landing of catches in such ports by vessels flying the flag of an EU Member State are subject to the rules in the third country. As of the withdrawal date, Union vessels wishing to land in the United Kingdom will be subject to the rules applicable in the United Kingdom

Council Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 of the European Parliament and of the Coun
l of 12 December 2017 on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets, OJ L 347, 28.12.2017, p. 81.

Access to ports of EU Member States, including port services and the use of first-stage marketing installations, as well as the conduct of landing and transhipment operations in such ports shall be prohibited for vessels flying the flag of a third country unless they meet the requirements laid down in Section I of Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008. As of the withdrawal date, these rules will appl
to United Kingdo
vessels wishing to land in the Union
The above is without prejudice to rules of international law of the sea applicable in cases of force majeure and distress. 3.
MPORT AND EXPORT OF FISHERY AND AQUACULTURE PRODUCTS 3.1. Flag State notification and catch certification According to Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, in order to export fishery products caught by third country flagged fishing vessels
to the EU, the Commission has to have received a notification from the flag State. As of the withdrawal date, this applies to the United Kingdom.  Fishery products
may only be imported to the EU when accompanied by a catch certificate (Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008). The catch certificate to be validated by the United Kingdom must certify that the catches concerned have been made in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and international conservation and management measures. The catch certificate must have been validated by the United Kingdom competent authority and, when required, accompanied by other documents envisaged by the certification scheme in the event of an indirect import after transhipment, transit or processing of the products in another third country (Article
14 and 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008). Export of catches made by Union fishing vessels to the United Kingdom will also be subject to the catch certification scheme if the United Kingdom certifies to the European Commission by way of notification that it has in place relevant implementation, control and enforcement arrangements and public authorities empowered to verify certificates (Article
15 and 20 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008).  3.2. Consumer information, labelling, and marketing requirements Fishery and aquaculture products placed on the EU market are subject to specific market requirements set out in Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013
which include the specific consumer information requirements (Chapter IV of Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013
and marketing standards on fishery and aquaculture products (Chapter III of Regulation (EU)

4 No 1379/2013). The rules include also the prohibition to sell fish below the minimum conservation reference size for direct human consumption.  Apart from these sector-specific requirements on the import and export of fishery and aquaculture products
the horizontal requirements in EU food law apply.10 These rules, be they sector-specific or horizontal, apply to all food placed on the EU market, independently of the place of production of the food.  As regards organic aquaculture, for products placed on the EU-27 market as of the withdrawal date, the certificates issued by control authorities and bodies in the United Kingdom are no longer valid.11 4. PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS Fishery and aquaculture producer organisations established pursuant to Article
of Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 and inter-branch organisations established pursuant to Article 11 of the same Regulation may only function within the Union and fulfil the tasks stipulated by Union law if recognised by Member State
in accordance with Section II of Chapter II of that Regulation. As of the withdrawal date, producer organisations and inter-branch organisations recognised in the United Kingdom on the basis of Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 will no longer be considered professional organisations under EU law.

UESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATED TO THE UNITED KINGDOM'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH REGARD TO FISHERIES
On 9 April 2018, the European Commission services published the "Notice to stakeholders  withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in the field of fisheries and aquaculture
On 28 March 2019, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted Regulation (EU) 2019/497
and Regulation (EU) 2019/498
which provide for contingency measures on fisheries with regard to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union.
This list of Questions and Answers (Q&As) give
further guidance on a situation where the United Kingdom (UK) becomes a third country without a ratified withdrawal agreement and hence without the transition period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement
The withdrawal date is 1 November 2019
In addition, these Q&As give additional guidance on the application of Regulation (EU) 2019/498

https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/fisheries_and_aquaculture_en.pdf
Regulation (EU) 2019/497 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 March 2019 amending Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 as regards certain rules relating to the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union, OJ L 85I, 27.3.2019, p. 22.
Regulation (EU) 2019/498 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 March 2019 amending Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 as regards fishing authorisations for Union fishing vessels in United Kingdom waters and fishing operations of United Kingdom fishing vessels in Union waters, OJ L 85I , 27.3.2019, p. 25.
The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. Following a request by the United Kingdom, the European Council (Article 50) agreed on 11 April 2019 (European Council Decision (EU) 2019/584, OJ L 101, 11.4.2019, p. 1) to extend further the period provided for in Article 50(3) TEU until 31 October 2019. This means that the United Kingdom will be, as of 1 November 2019 Withdrawal Agreement is ratified by both parties before that date, the withdrawal takes place on the first day of the month following the completion of the ratification procedures.

1.
ISHING IN UNION WATERS
THIRD COUNTRY WATERS AND HIGH SEAS 1.1. Will the fishing opportunities regulation 2019
still be applicable in the EU as of the withdrawal date
Yes. The fishing opportunities regulation 2019 will remain applicable to EU Member States in waters other than the UK waters.  1.2. Can UK control and enforcement authorities demand that I allow them to inspect my fishing vessel, even if I am not in UK waters? Do my obligations as master during control (according to Regulations (EC) No 1224/20
6 and (EU) 404/20117) still apply? No. As of the withdrawal date, these control regulations no longer apply to the United Kingdom. UK authorities will not be allowed to carry out inspections in Union waters. Regarding inspections in international waters, the control and enforcement modalities applicable by the relevant fisheries organisations remain valid. 2.
ISHING IN UK WATERS 2.1. Will the fishing opportunities regulation 2019 apply to the United Kingdom as of the withdrawal date
No. As of the withdrawal date, Union law  including the fishing opportunities regulation 2019  no longer applies to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom will have to define the fishing opportunities for UK vessels in domestic legislation.  This also means that Union vessels are allowed to fish in UK waters according to EU law only up until the withdrawal date
2.2. Will the United Kingdom stick to the quotas agreed for 2019? This is a decision for the United Kingdom to make. In the future, c
operation with the United Kingdom on fisheries will have to be based on alternative legal frameworks and cooperation mechanisms, based on international law and UK national or EU law respectively.

Council Regulation (EU) 2019/124 of 30 January 2019 fixing for 2019 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Union waters and, for Union fishing vessels, in certain non-Union waters OJ L 29, 31.1.2019, p. 1.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy, OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 1.
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 of 8 April 2011 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy, OJ L 112, 30.4.2011, p. 1.
3 2.3. Will EU vessels be able to continue to fish in UK waters? As of the withdrawal date, access to UK waters will only be possible if the United Kingdom explicitly authorises that
and if the flag State authorises the vessel to fish in UK waters.  As set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/498, the EU is ready to provide continued access to its waters until 31 December 2019, if the United Kingdom is going to provide access to its waters for the EU vessels, and respects the terms of the fishing opportunities regulation 2019. Regulation (EU) 2019/498 set
out the procedure to be followed by vessels in order to obtain authorisations that will be required by the United Kingdom and from their flag State to fish in UK waters. In practice: the flag Member State will have to provide the information required by the United Kingdom to the Commission, which will send the request for authorisation to the United Kingdom
2.4.
hat if there is a lag in obtaining such authorisations from the United Kingdom after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom?  As long as Union vessels are not authorised to access UK waters, they cannot fish in these waters as of the withdrawal date
In order to address the potential economic cost of a temporary disruption to access to UK waters for most affected operators, Regulation (EU) 2019/497 gives the possibility to Member States to use support under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund for temporary cessation of fishing activities for fishermen and operators that have significant dependence on access to UK waters
2.5. Will the EU fleet be allowed to continue to land in UK ports? As of the withdrawal date, access to UK ports and landings in those ports are subject to UK rules.  Should a Union vessel land in a UK port, the products will be subject to sanitary and customs checks by UK authorities, as well as any other fisheries-specific checks established in UK legislation. 2.6. Will the UK fleet be allowed to continue to land in EU-27 ports as of the withdrawal date
Yes, subject to the EU rules applicable to third-country vessels, notably on designated ports and prior notice.

Cf. Section 1 of Chapter II of Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29 September 2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, OJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 1.
4 2.7. Will Union vessels need an International Maritime Organization (IMO) number to fish in UK waters? Should Union vessels be authorised to fish in UK waters, they will have to follow EU rules on the management of the EU fleet active in the waters of a third country and they will have to abide by the applicable UK legislation (incl. relevant rules on IMO numbers)
According to point (b) of the the second sub-paragraph of Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 404/2011, the IMO number applies to all Union fishing vessels or fishing vessels controlled by Union operators under a chartering arrangement, of 15 metres length overall and above, operating outside Union waters. 2.8. Who communicates to the EU fishermen whether they are authorised or not to continue to fish in UK waters as of the withdrawal date
It is the responsibility of fishermen themselves to know the rules and regulations in place and act in accordance with them. Vessels may continue fishing only on the basis of a valid authorisation. As set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/498, the EU is ready to provide continued access to its waters until 31 December 2019, if the United Kingdom is going to provide access to its waters for the EU vessels, and respects the terms of the fishing opportunities regulation 2019. Should there be, on this basis, continued access to UK waters for EU vessels, the Commission will inform the Member States. The flag Member State is then expected to inform its fishermen adequately about applicable rules and procedures
3.
THER ASPECTS RELATING TO FISHING ACTIVITIES 3.1. Can
Union vessel continue to transit UK waters as of the withdrawal date
Yes, iterritorial sea and freedom of navigation in the exclusive economic zone. In absence of an authorisation to fish in these waters, fishing vessels in transit must have gear stowed and secured so that it is not readily available for fishing
3.2. If I fish near the exclusive economic zone border and drift into UK waters when I am gathering my trawl, will that be regarded as fishing in UK waters? Yes. The hauling of active fishing gears is a fishing operation that requires authorisation in accordance with Art 3(2)(g) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2403. It is also defined as a fishing activity by Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009. Therefore, and as it already happens with fishing activities close to neighbouring third countries' waters, the hauling operation must take place
in Union waters unless the Union vessel is authorised to fish within UK waters. 3.3.
ill UK control and enforcement authorities have access to Union fishing vessel monitoring system (VMS) data and logbook data from FLUX? No. However, as set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/498, the EU is ready to provide continued access to its waters until 31 December 2019, if the United Kingdom is going to provide access to its waters for the EU vessels, and respects the terms of the fishing opportunities regulation 2019. In this case, consideration will be given to the continued exchange of VMS and logbook data via FLUX.
3.4. If I spot a UK fishing vessel in Union waters, who should I contact? Any sighting of a third country vessel in Union waters and any evidence of potential illegal fishing activities by fishing vessels in Union waters should be brought to the attention of the control authorities of the relevant coastal Member State.  3.5. What kind of reporting will be required upon entry into UK waters as of the withdrawal date
This will depend on the relevant UK requirements.  3.6. Will quota swaps with the United Kingdom still be possible as of the withdrawal date
No.  However, as set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/498, the EU is ready to provide continued access to its waters until 31 December 2019, if the United Kingdom is going to provide access to its waters for the EU vessels, and respects the terms of the fishing opportunities regulation 2019. In this case, the possibility of quota swaps with the UK is maintained in 2019 and the Commission will execute the formal quota exchange with the United Kingdom in line with the specific procedure set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/498
3.7. What fisheries conservation and control rules apply to fishing by an EU vessel, before the withdrawal date, in UK waters, if the EU vessel lands in an EU port after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom? The EU rules of the Common Fisheries Policy will apply in this case
3.8. What fisheries conservation and control rules apply to fishing by an EU vessel, before the withdrawal date, in UK waters, if the EU vessel lands in a UK port after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom? As of the withdrawal date, the UK fisheries rules will apply to this case.
6 4.
USTOMS STATUS
CUSTOMS FORMALITIES AND CUSTOMS DUTIES  4.1. What is the customs status of fish caught by an EU vessel
in the UK exclusive economic zone when brought to the customs territory of the Union
For the purpose of the customs status of Union goods for products of sea-fishing the exclusive economic zone is treated in the same way as high sea, therefore, the general rules on the customs status of products of sea-fishing apply, whether the fish was caught there by an EU vessel before or as of the withdrawal date
4.2. What is the customs status of fish caught by an EU vessel as of the withdrawal date in UK territorial waters? Those products of sea-fishing will have the customs status of non-Union goods when brought to the customs territory of the Union. When released for free circulation, they shall be granted relief from import duty according to Article 208(1)(a) of the Union Customs Code10 (see also below, Q&A 4.6). 4.3. What is the customs status of fish caught by an EU vessel in UK territorial waters before the withdrawal date, but landed in an EU port after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom? In this case, the products of sea-fishing will keep the customs status of Union goods subject to a proof thereof (cf. Article 119(3)(a) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/244611). 4.4. Do customs formalities apply to an EU vessel landing in an EU port after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom, after having caught fish in UK territorial waters before the withdrawal date? In general, where an EU vessel catches fish in the territorial waters of a Member State and then lands the fish in a port in the same or in another Member State without leaving the territorial waters (i.e. it is all the time in the customs territory of the Union), no customs formalities will apply, as the fish will be presumed to have the customs status of Union goods (Article 153(1) of the Union Customs Code
However, customs may check whether the vessel has remained in the territorial waters all the time.  Nonetheless, in this specific situation of the UK withdrawal, i
an EU vessel lands fish caught in the UK territorial waters before the withdrawal date in an
1(44) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446). 10
Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code, OJ L 269, 10.10.2013, p. 1. 11
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 of 28 July 2015 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards detailed rules concerning certain provisions of the Union Customs Code, OJ L 343, 29.12.2015, p. 1.
7 EU port as of that date, customs may ask for a proof of status of that fish according to Article 130 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446
Where an EU vessel catches fish in the territorial waters of a Member State and crosses the high sea before landing the fish in a port in the same or in another Member State, the customs status of Union goods of the fish will have to be proven (Article 119(3)(a) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446). Until then it will remain under customs supervision. 4.5. What rules apply to fish caught by an EU vessel at high sea, transhipped and transported through the UK and then brought to the EU as of the withdrawal date? Where the fish is landed in the UK before the withdrawal date, but it cannot be excluded that it reaches the EU only as of that date, it is advisable to provide the truck driver with documents proving the customs status of Union goods of the fish.12 Where the fish is landed in the UK as of the withdrawal date, the general rules for transhipment and transport through a country or territory which is not part of the customs territory of the Union apply. In the case of the UK, the fish can also be placed under a transit procedure, as the UK will become a Contracting Party to the Convention on a common transit procedure as of the withdrawal date in the no deal situation.  4.6. Do customs duties apply to fish caught in UK territorial waters by an EU vessel? According to Article 208(1)(a) of the Union Customs Code, fish taken from the territorial sea of a country or territory outside the customs territory of the Union by vessels solely registered or recorded in a Member State and flying the flag of that State is exempted from duties. Hence, no duties for fish caught by EU vessels in UK territorial waters will be due, no matter if the vessel lands in an EU port before or after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom. Evidence has to be provided that the conditions laid down in the Article 208(1) of the Union Customs Code are fulfilled. 4.7. Do customs duties apply to fish caught in Union waters by an EU vessel (before or after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom), but landed in an UK port as of the withdrawal date? As of the withdrawal date, UK rules will apply in this case. 4.8. What customs tariffs apply in the EU as of the withdrawal date? Tariff Schedule will apply. Regarding the customs tariffs and the calculation of the customs debt, please                                                            12

which is subject to the usual procedure under the WTO.    On 13 March 2019 the United Kingdom has published temporary preferential and non-preferential (MFN) tariffs that will apply for a period up to 12 months in the event of no deal and special arrangements regarding the border on the island of Ireland.14

EUROPEAN COMMISSION DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR MOBILITY AND TRANSPORT
Brussels, 19 January 201
NOTICE TO STAKEHOLDERS
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES ON THE MINIMUM LEVEL OF TRAINING OF SEAFARERS AND THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION OF SEAFARER
CERTIFICATES The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date
all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, all seafarers subject to Directive 2008/106/EC on the minimum level of training of seafarers
and Directive 2005/45/EC on the mutual recognition of seafarers' certificates issued by the Member States

international carriage shall be subject to a Community licence
and, when the driver is a national of a third country, in conjunction with a driver attestation.  Thus, as of the withdrawal date, drivers who are United Kingdom nationals and do not constitute long-term residents in the Union, within the meaning of Council Directive 2003/109/EC, and who work for a Union haulier holding a Community licence require a driver attestation
In accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1072/20097, this driver attestation shall be issued by the competent authorities of the Member State of establishment of the haulier holding a Community licence for each driver who is neither a national nor a long-term resident within the meaning of Council Directive 2003/109/EC

Certificate of professional competence for drivers: In accordance with Directive 2003/59/EC9, drivers in the Union of a vehicle intended for the carriage of goods or for the carriage of passengers need to hold a certificate of professional competence certifying the initial qualification or periodic training and issued by competent authorities of a
EU Member State or by an approved training centre in an EU Member State. Drivers who are nationals of an EU Member State obtain their initial qualification in the EU Member State of their normal residence while drivers who are nationals of third countries do this in the EU Member State which issued a work permit to them.

CCESS TO THE PROFESSION
TO THE MARKET
According to Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009, undertakings engaged in the occupation of road transport operator in the Union must have an effective and stable establishment in an EU Member State. As of the withdrawal date, undertakings that have their establishment in the United Kingdom will no longer fulfil this requirement.
According to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009, an undertaking which engages in the occupation of road transport operator shall designate a transport manager. In accordance with Article 4(1)(c) of that Regulation, this transport manager has to be resident in the Union. As of the withdrawal date, transport managers resident in the United Kingdom working for a Union road transport operator will no longer fulfil this requirement. Undertakings established in the Union that only have a transport manager resident in the United Kingdom can no longer engage in the occupation of road transport operator within the EU-27
o The international carriage of goods in the Union is subject to possession of a Community licence, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009. These Community licences can only be issued by the competent authorities of the EU Member State in which the haulier is established and where such haulier is entitled to carry out the international carriage of goods by road. As of the withdrawal date, a Community licence issued by the competent authorities of the United Kingdom will no longer be valid in the EU
7. Hauliers established in the United Kingdom will no longer have access to the internal road haulage market in the Union.  However, the multilateral quota system managed by the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (now International Transport Forum) would apply at that point
Hence, cross-trade operations (i.e. the carriage of goods from country A to country B by a haulier established in country C) by United Kingdom hauliers in the Union and by Union hauliers from or to the United Kingdom could be carried out under that system and within the limits thereof. That system does not permit cabotage operations, i.e. operations by foreign carriers within a single State.  This means
in particular
that United Kingdom hauliers will no longer be able to perform cabotage operations within any of the EU-27 Member States.                                                  11
For further information the responsible authority of the respective Member State should be consulted.

In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1073/200912, the international carriage of passengers by coach and bus is subject to the possession of a Community licence issued by the competent authorities of the Member State of establishment. As of the withdrawal date, Community licences issued by the United Kingdom will no longer be valid in the EU-27.
Regular international services between Member States are subject to an authorisation in accordance with Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009. As of the withdrawal date, authorisations involving the United Kingdom (for pick up or set down of passengers) are no longer valid in the EU-27

NTERNATIONAL ASPECTS
As of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom is no longer within the scope of the Interbus Agreement13 on the international occasional carriage of passengers by coach and bus, the very similar ASOR Agreement of 1982, 14 as well as the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Carriage of Goods and Passengers by Rail and Road.15

WITHDRAWAL OF THE
NITED
INGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF INLAND WATERWAYS The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date
all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities, but also for private parties.
In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, all inland waterway transport operators are reminded of legal repercussions
which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of inland waterway transport no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences:

A third country is a country not member of the EU.
This notice does not address the issue of technical requirements for inland waterway vessels, under Directive 2006/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 laying down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels (OJ L 389, 30.12.2006, p. 1). Regarding these rules, the United Kingdom has authorised a derogation in accordance with Article 7(1) of that Directive. A similar possibility for derogation is contained in Article 24(1) of Directive 2016/1629 (OJ L 252, 16.9.2016, p. 118), repealing Directive 2006/87/EC with effect from 7 October 2018

ARITIME SECURITY Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security
and Directive 2005/65/EC on enhancing port security
set out the EU rules on maritime security.   Article
of Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 requires the competent authority for maritime security of the Member State to request ships announcing their intention to enter
port to provide certain security information. According to Article 7(1),(2) of Regulation (EC) No 725/2004, Member States can request each other, for international scheduled services operated between them, to exempt these services from providing this mandatory security information. As of the withdrawal date, this possibility, as provided by Regulation (EC) No 725/2004, no longer exists for the United Kingdom. This means that, as of the withdrawal date, all scheduled services falling within the scope of Article 6 of

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF RAIL TRANSPORT The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, all stakeholders are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of rail transport no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences in the different areas of rail transport: 1.
ANAGEMENT AND USE OF RAILWAY INFRASTRUCTURE According to Chapter III of Directive 2012/34/E
establishing a single European railway area
in order to provide rail transport services, railway undertakings need a licence: they are entitled to apply for it in the EU Member State where they are established. The licence is valid throughout the territory of the Union, as long as the undertaking fulfils the obligations laid down in Chapter III of Directive
Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 establishing a single European railway area, OJ L 343 14.12.2012, p. 32

2012/34/EU. As of the withdrawal date, licences issued by the United Kingdom will no longer be valid in the EU-27. Railway undertakings holding such a licence and wishing to continue operating in the EU-27 as of the withdrawal date will have to apply for a new licence in an EU-27 Member State in accordance with Chapter III of Directive 2012/34/E
Railway undertakings providing cross-border services between the United Kingdom and the EU-27 and wishing to continue after the withdrawal date, will have to comply with the legal requirements applicable both in the EU-27 and the United Kingdom. These undertakings will therefore have to ensure that they have a licence valid in the EU-27 for the sections of the cross-border services located in the territory of the EU-27. It follows from Article 17(1) of Directive 2012/34/EU that establishment in one of the EU-27 Member States is a precondition for acquiring an EU-27 licence. 2.
AILWAY SAFETY
According to Article 10 of Directive 2004/49/EC on safety on the Community's railways
access to railway infrastructure in the Union by a railway undertaking is subject to having obtained a safety certificate issued by a Member State. As of the withdrawal date, safety certificates delivered in the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 10 of the Directive will no longer be valid in the EU-27
Railway undertaking
holding such a certificate and wanting to continue operating in the EU-27 as of the withdrawal date will have to apply for a new certificate in an EU-27 Member State
in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 2004/49/EC
According to Article 14a(4) of Directive 2004/49/EC, each entity in charge of maintenance (ECM) of freight wagons is subject to a certification requirement. As of the withdrawal date, certificates issued by the United Kingdom will no longer be valid in the EU-27.
ECMs holding a certificate delivered by the United Kingdom and wishing to continue their professional activities in the European Union will have to apply for a certificate in an EU-27 Member State. In addition, as of the withdrawal date, ECMs may apply for a certificate according to the legal framework of the Convention concerning international carriage by rail (COTIF), to which the 26 EU Member States with a railway system
are parties

6
More specifically, they will need a safety certificate part A issued by a EU-27 Member State in order to operate in the EU and safety certificates part B from each of the Member States in which they would operate.
This also holds for certificates by ECM certification bodies recognised by the United Kingdom or accredited by the United Kingdom accreditation body in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 445/2011 on a system of certification of entities in charge of maintenance for freight wagons and amending Regulation (EC) No 653/2007 (OJ L 122, 11.5.2011, p. 22).

AILWAY INTEROPERABILITY10
lacing on the market of railway products covered by Directive 2008/57/EC: For those products, the European Union's Technical Specifications for Interoperability set out the applicable conformity assessment procedures and whether, for each of them, a third party intervention (Notified Body or Designated Body) is required or not. In terms of the placing on the market of such products, this notice should be read in conjunction with the generic notice to economic operators subject to Union legislation in the field of industrial products,11 particularly its section 2 on conformity assessment procedures and Notified Bodies. The consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU set out in the generic notice fully apply to certificates issued by bodies notified (in the case of Notified Bodies) or designated (in the case of Designated Bodies) by the United Kingdom (hereafter "Notified Bodies/Designated Bodies in the United Kingdom"). The following paragraphs deal with the specific cases concerning the placing on the market and use of interoperability constituents and the placing in service of vehicles and subsystems
Placing on the market and use of interoperability constituents: According to Articles 10 and 13(2) of Directive 2008/57/EC on the interoperability of the rail system within the Community,12 the placing on the market of an interoperability constituent may require an assessment of conformity/suitability for use established by
Notified Body. Where an assessment established by a Notified Body is required, the consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU set out in the generic notice on industrial products referred to in the preceding paragraph fully apply
An interoperability constituent placed on the market before the withdrawal date with a certificate of conformity/suitability for use issued by a Notified Body in the United Kingdom can be used, during the duration of validity of the certificates of conformity/suitability for use, in subsystems or vehicles the placing in service of which has been authorised before the withdrawal date.
Placing in service of vehicles and subsystems: According to Article 21 of Directive 2008/57/EC, before being used on a network, a railway vehicle has to be authorised to be placed in service by the national safety authority which is
See Article 15(2) of Appendix G to COTIF, and the Uniform Rules set out in accordance with that Article, in relation to the ECM certification in the COTIF framework. For the interaction between the ECM certifications pursuant to Directive 2004/49/EC and to the COTIF framework, see Article 3a(5) of the same Appendix
10
The principles set out in this section will also apply in the framework of Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on the interoperability of the rail system within the European Union (recast) (OJ L 138, 26.5.2016, p. 44) when the relevant provisions become applicable in the respective EU Member States

4 competent for this network in accordance with that Directive. Authorisations for placing in service of vehicles pursuant to Article 21 of Directive 2008/57/EC delivered in the EU-27 before the withdrawal date will retain their validity after the withdrawal date even if they have been authorised based on certificates of verification issued by Notified Bodies/Designated Bodies in the United Kingdom. The same applies to authorisations for placing in service of subsystems according to Articles 15 and 20 of Directive 2008/57/EC. As of the withdrawal date, however, authorisations for placing in service pursuant to Articles 15, 20 and 21 of Directive 2008/57/EC shall be based on certificates of verification issued by Notified Bodies/Designated Bodies in the EU-27
As of the withdrawal date, the use of railway material authorised in the United Kingdom in international traffic in the EU will be governed by COTIF, and in particular the Appendices G13 and F14 thereto

RAIN DRIVER CERTIFICATION  Directive 2007/59/EC15 lays down the conditions and procedures for the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Union. In particular, it requires that the train driver obtains a specific licence and a specific certificate. The licence is issued by a competent authority of a Member State while the certificate is issued by the railway undertakings and infrastructure managers. According to Article 7, a licence issued by a Member State is valid throughout the territory of the Union while the certificate is valid on those infrastructures and rolling stock identified on it. As of the withdrawal date, licenses and certificates for train drivers issued in the United Kingdom will no longer be valid in the EU-27.
rain drivers with a licence/certificate issued in the United Kingdom and working in another Member State should take the necessary steps in order to obtain certification documents valid in the EU-27 as of the withdrawal date. Therefore, railway undertakings or infrastructure managers in the EU employing train drivers with certification documents issued in the United Kingdom are invited to inform these persons of the need to obtain new certification documents valid in the EU-27 as of the withdrawal date
Railway undertakings providing cross-border services between the United Kingdom and the EU-27 and wishing to continue after the withdrawal date, will have to ensure that the drivers on the sections of such cross-border services                                                  13

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES ON TRANSPORTABLE PRESSURE EQUIPMENT The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Following
request by the United Kingdom, the European Council (Article 50) agreed on 11 April 2019
to extend further
the period provided for in Article 50(3) TEU until 31 October 2019.
This means that the United Kingdom will be, as of 1 November 2019 a third country

Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties. In view of the uncertainties surrounding the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement
all interested parties, and especially economic operators, are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to the transition period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement,
as of the withdrawal date the EU rules on transportable pressure equipment, and in particular Directive 2010/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2010 on
European Council Decision (EU) 2019/584, OJ L 101, 11.4.2019, p. 1.
Following a request by the United Kingdom, the European Council had decided a first extension on 22 March 2019 (European Council Decision (EU) 2019/476, OJ L 80 I, 22.3.2019, p. 1).
On 11 April 2019, following a second request for an extension by the United Kingdom, the European Council also decided that the decision to extend until 31 October 2019 would cease to apply on 31 May 2019 if the United Kingdom had not held elections to the European Parliament and had not ratified the Withdrawal Agreement by 22 May 2019. As the United Kingdom had not ratified the Withdrawal Agreement by 22 May 2019, it held European elections on 23 May 2019.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
In addition, if the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified by both parties before that date, the withdrawal takes place on the first day of the month following the completion of the ratification procedures.

1. TRANSPORTABLE PRESSURE EQUIPMENT PLACED ON THE UNION (EU-27) MARKET  Directive 2010/35/EU provides for rules ensuring the safety of transportable pressure equipment made available on the EU market. Regarding the need for a certificate issued by a Notified Body established in one of the EU-27 Member States, the requirement for the authorised representative to be established within the EU-27 and the identification of the importer, please refer to the  withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in of 22 January 201810 and the related document of 1 February 2019.11 The relevant criterion to determine the extent to which there may be consequences from the UK withdrawal for a specific product covered by Directive 2010/35/EU is the date of its placing on the Union (E
27) market. According to Article 12 of Directive 2010/35/EU, transportable pressure equipment in use is subject to periodic inspections, intermediate inspections and exceptional checks in accordance with the Annexes to Directive 2008/68/EC and Chapters 3 and 4 of Directive 2010/35/EU. In order to ensure the continuity of the free movement of transportable pressure equipment in use, as of the withdrawal date
any required periodic inspections, intermediate inspections and exceptional checks will need to be performed by an EU-27 Notified Body. Article 13 of Directive 2010/35/EU provides that transportable pressure equipment manufactured and put into service before the date of implementation of Directive 1999/36/EC of 29 April 1999 on transportable pressure equipment12 (repealed by Directive 2010/35/EU) requires a reassessment of conformity in accordance with the conformity reassessment procedures set out in Annex III to Directive 2010/35/EU. As of the withdrawal date, the reassessment of conformity will need to be performed by an EU-27 Notified Body. Directive 2010/35/EU does not apply to transportable pressure equipment exclusively used for the transport of dangerous goods between the territory of the Union and that of third countries13, which is carried out in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2008/68/E
(see Section 2 below).

Questions and Answers related to the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union with regard to the medicinal products for human and veterinary use within the framework of the Centralised Procedure
This list of Questions and Answers (Q&As) complements the "Notice to stakeholders
withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules for medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products".
(NEW)This list of Q&As addresses a situation where the United Kingdom becomes a third country on 30 March 2019 ("the withdrawal date") without a withdrawal agreement and hence without a transition period provided for in the draft Withdrawal Agreement.  This list has been drafted jointly by the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety of the European Commission and EMA. This version is a
update of the initial list of Q&As published on 31 May 2017 as subsequently amended and it replaces all previous versions of Q&As. The new text introduced in this version of Q&As "Rev
" is indicated by the word "NEW". The Q&As may be further updated and complemented in the future
The advice below applies equally to medicinal products for human or veterinary use, unless otherwise indicated in the heading to the question. 1. What if I am a marketing authorisation holder established in the UK? According to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the marketing authorisation holder must be established in the Union. Through the EEA Agreement this is extended to include also Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. For centrally authorised medicinal products the marketing authorisation holder will therefore normally need to transfer its marketing authorisation to a holder established in the Union (EEA) (see Commission Regulation (EC) 2141/96 and EMA Q&A on transfer). This means that the addressee of the marketing authorisation decision changes to the new addressee
The transfer of the marketing authorisation must be fully completed and implemented by the marketing authorisation holder before 30 March 2019.

1a. What if I am an applicant established in the UK?
ny marketing authorisation applicant must be established in the Union (EEA). Therefore, for marketing authorisation applications (MAAs) that are expected to receive a Commission Decision after 29 March 2019, applicants established in the UK will need to change to a non-UK applicant established in the Union (EEA) before 30 March 2019. It is strongly recommended that applicants established in the UK consider such change, where possible, in advance of the submission of the MAA
2. What if I am an orphan designation holder established in the UK
(for medicines for human use
According to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 the sponsor of an orphan medicinal product designation must be established in the Union (EEA)
For designated orphan medicinal products the holder will therefore need to transfer its designation to a holder established in the Union (EEA
(see Checklist for sponsors applying for the transfer of Orphan Medicinal Product (OMP) designation and the corresponding template) or it will need to change its place of establishment to a Member State of the Union (or EEA) and submit the corresponding documentation through a change of name and/or address of the orphan designation holder procedure provided the legal entity remain
the same (see Guideline on the format and content of applications for designation as orphan medicinal products and on the transfer of designations from one sponsor to another, 27.03.2014). 3. What if I am a UK company with a MUMS (Minor Use Minor Species/limited market) status for my product? (for veterinary medicines
According to Article 79 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the Management Board of the European Medicines Agency should, in the case of veterinary products which have limited markets, or in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for diseases with a regional distribution, adopt the necessary measures to provide assistance to companies at the time of submission of their applications. This activity supports applicants for marketing authorisations, which in accordance with the general rules have to be established in the Union (EEA) (see Question 1a above).  If the sponsor/applicant is established in the UK, the MUMS incentives provided on the basis of Article 79 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 would no longer be applicable with effect from the date of thcannot seek and receive MUMS/limited market classification in the Union (EEA). However, MUMS/limited market classification is connected to the product/indication and therefore transferable together with the product.  To formally acknowledge the transfer, the EMA requires a letter from the original sponsor/applicant officially informing the EMA of the transfer of the classification product and the MUMS/limited market classification from the original sponsor/applicant to a sponsor/ applicant established in the Union (EEA). This letter should state the document reference number of the MUMS outcome letter confirming the MUMS classification.  For already authorised MUMS/limited market veterinary medicinal products it is important to note that a transfer of marketing authorisation does not include a transfer of an MUMS/limited designation as this is subject to a different procedure. Therefore, for those authorised MUMS/limited market veterinary medicinal products the marketing authorisation holder needs to ation (see above). The five year period of validity for MUMS/limited market classification is not affected by the transfer of classification


4. What if my Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance (QPPV) resides and carries out his/her tasks in the UK?  According to Article 8 of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 74 of Directive 2001/82/EC
the qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance must reside and carry out his/her tasks in a Member State of the Union (EEA). The QPPV will therefore need to change his/her place of residence and carry out his/her tasks in the Union (EEA) or a new QPPV residing and carrying out his/her tasks in the Union (EEA) will need to be appointed. Changes in the QPPV, including contact details (telephone, and fax numbers, postal address and email address) may, for medicinal products for human use, be updated through the Article 57 database only (without the need for a variation) (see Variation Guideline C.I.
. Regarding medicinal products for veterinary use the changes should be updated through a variation (see Variation Guideline (2013/C 223/01), classification C.I.9)
5. What if my Pharmacovigilance System Master File is located in the UK (PSMF)
(for medicines for human use
According to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012, the PSMF must be located within the Union (EEA). The supervisory authority for pharmacovigilance is the competent authority of the Member State in which the pharmacovigilance system master file is located
The marketing authorisation holder will therefore need to change the location of the PSMF to a Member State within the Union (EEA). Changes to the location of the PSMF (street, city, postcode, country) may be updated through the Article 57 database only (without the need for a variation) (see Variation Guideline (2013/ C 223/01), classification C.I.8)
6. What if my manufacturing site of the active substance is located in the UK?
As of the date of the withdrawal of the UK from the Union, active substances manufactured in the UK will be considered imported active substances. Directive 2001/83/EC  and Directive 2001/82/EC
tate that manufacturing authorisation holders are obliged to use, as starting materials, only active substances that have been manufactured in accordance with the detailed guidelines on GMP for starting materials.  In addition, pursuant to Article 46b(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC, active substances for medicinal products for human use shall only be imported in the Union (EEA) if, inter alia, the active substances are accompanied by a written confirmation from the competent authority of the exporting third country which, as regards the plant manufacturing the exported active substance, confirms that the standards of good manufacturing practice and control of the plant are equivalent to those in the Union (EEA)
7. What if my manufacturing site of the finished product is located in the UK?
As of the date of the withdrawal of the UK from the Union, medicinal products manufactured in the UK will be considered imported medicinal products. The competent authorities of the Union (EEA) shall ensure that the import of medicinal products into their territory is subject to an authorisation in accordance with Article 40(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 44(3) Of Directive 2001/82/EC. The authorisation is granted when a number of conditions
as defined in Articles 41 and 42 of Directive 2001/83/EC and Articles 45 and 46 of Directive 2001/82/EC
are fulfilled (e.g. availability of a qualified person within the Union (EEA), GMP inspection). For centrally authorised medicinal products the marketing authorisation holder will therefore need to specify an authorised importer established in the Union (EEA) and submit the corresponding variation (see Variation Guideline (2013/ C 223/01), classification B.II.b.2).  In addition, in accordance with Article 51
)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 55(1)(b) of Directive 2001/82/EC the marketing authorisation holder will need to specify a site of batch control in the Union (EEA) where each production batch can undergo upon importation a full qualitative analysis, a quantitative analysis of at least all the active substances and all the other
tests or checks necessary to ensure the quality of medicinal products in accordance with the requirements of the marketing authorisation. For centrally authorised medicinal products the marketing authorisation holder will need to change the location of its current UK based site of batch control to a location established in the Union (EEA) and submit the corresponding variation (see Variation Guideline (2013/ C 223/01), classification B.II.b.2).   8. What if my batch release site is located in the UK?
In accordance with Article 51
) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 55
) of Directive 2001/82/EC, the qualified person of the manufacturing and importation authorisation holder is responsible to certify that each batch of medicinal product intended to be placed on the EEA market was manufactured in accordance with the Union GMP requirements and the marketing authorisation. The batch release site has to be located in the Union (EEA). For centrally authorised medicinal products the marketing authorisation holder will therefore need to transfer its current UK based site of batch release to a location established in the Union (EEA) and submit the corresponding variation (see Variation Guideline (2013/ C 223/01), classification B.II.b.2).  9. I am a UK based SME, would I still have access to financial and administrative assistance in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No
In order to be eligible for financial and administrative assistance, companies must be established in the Union (EEA
and meet the definition of an SME. As of the date of the withdrawal of the UK from the Union, the guidance for non-EEA based companies shall apply also to UK based companies:  to apply for SME status once the company has established a legal entity in the Union (EEA
For proof of establishment, the SME office requires a copy of the certificate of incorporation in the commercial register of the companies. In such cases, the SME declaration can be submitted in the name of the newly established subsidiary with details of the parent company to be declared.  to indirectly benefit from the SME incentives through an Union (EEA
established SME regulatory consultancy. SME regulatory consultancies may seek to benefit from the provisions of the SME Regulation on behalf of non-EEA based clients
only if both they and the client meet the SME criteria (i.e. fall below headcount and financial thresholds). In this case, both the regulatory consultancy and the non-EEA based company should submit SME declarations. If successful, the regulatory consultancy would receive an SME notification and the non-EEA based company would be listed in an annex to that notification as an SME client company. It is not possible for an SME regulatory consultancy to be considered eligible if they are acting on behalf of non-SME clients, as this would be contrary to the objectives of the SME Regulation. Further information is available on the EMA website (link) and in the SME User Guide (link

10. marketing authorisation or application based on a reference product authorised in the UK
A generic or hybrid application in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC or Article 13 of Directive 2001/82/EC refers to information that is contained in the dossier of a reference medicinal product (RefMP) that is or has been authorised in the Union (EEA).
Generic/hybrid marketing authorisations granted before 30 March 2019 referring to a RefMP authorised by the UK (UK RefMP) remain valid
Generic/hybrid applications for which marketing authorisations will be granted after 29 March 2019 should refer to a RefMP that is or has been authorised in a EU-27 Member State or a contracting state of the EEA.
4
Applicants are advised to take this into account already at the time of submission of the application
11. Can medicinal products used in bioequivalence studies be sourced in the UK?  According to Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC or Article 13(1) of Directive 2001/82/EC the applicant can submit an abridged application if he can demonstrate that the medicinal product is a generic of a reference medicinal product which is or has been authorised in the Union or EEA for not less than eight years. According to Article 10(2)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 13(2)(b) of Directive 2001/82/EC generic medicinal product means a medicinal product which has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product, and whose bioequivalence with the reference medicinal product has been demonstrated by appropriate bioavailability studies.
(NEW) Pivotal studies (bioequivalence, in vitro dissolution tests or therapeutic equivalence studies, as appropriate) that have been conducted with a medicinal product sourced in the UK can be used in generic/hybrid marketing authorisation applications only if the marketing authorisation for that application will be granted before 30 March 2019.

2 See also the electronic application form for marketing authorisation applications, section 1.4.2.2 or 1.4.3.2
This will also facilitate management of generic/hybrid product's life cycle in the post-authorisation phase, considering for example the need to implement changes to the product information of the EEA RefMP also for the generic/hybrid products.
The (exceptional) situation where a RefMP is or has been authorised in the UK only is addressed in the EU's "Position paper on Goods placed on the Market under Union law before the withdrawal date" (footnote 7)
https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/position-paper-goods-placed-market-under-union-law-withdrawal-date_en

See also the electronic application form for marketing authorisation applications, section 1.4.2.3 or 1.4.3.3
In exceptional cases where bioequivalence studies are intended for use in new applications which will be submitted before 30 March 2019 and if these bioequivalence studies have been already completed the applicants may consider contacting the competent authority to discuss the particular circumstances of their application in order to avoid unnecessary repetition of studies in humans or animals. (NEW) In cases where bioequivalence studies have been conducted with a reference product sourced in the UK before 30 March 2019 and when this product is the same as an EU27 reference product, authorised either via the centralised procedure or mutual recognition or decentralised procedure based on the same dossier, the applicants may consider contacting the competent authority to discuss the particular circumstances of their application also in cases when the application cannot be submitted before 30 March 2019, in order to avoid unnecessary repetition of studies in humans or animals.

12. authorisation or biosimilar marketing authorisation application? (for medicines for human use)
The considerations described under question
10 and 11 regarding the choice of RefMP are also applicable to biosimilars.  The Guideline on similar biological medicinal products should however be consulted for the available scientific guidance when considering using a non-EEA authorised comparator (i.e. a non-EEA authorised version of the reference medicinal product) in the development of a biosimilar.  Batches of the RefMP released by the UK after 29 March 2019 will not be considered as a Union (EEA) authorised comparator. 13. Authorisation (GMA) concept?  The concept of 'global marketing authorisation within the meaning of Article 6(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/82/EC covers the initial marketing authorisation and all subsequent developments of the original medicinal product, irrespective of their authorisation procedures, namely variation or grant of a separate MA
to the same MAH
The GMA is accompanied only by a single regulatory data protection period
which applies both to data relating to the original medicinal product
and to data presented for any subsequent developments. That regulatory data protection period begins with the grant of the initial marketing authorisation in the Union (EEA)
Marketing authorisations granted before 30 March 2019 by the UK can still be considered as the initial marketing authorisation. 14. Union affect well-established use applications?  According to Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 13a of Directive 2001/82/EC it is possible to replace results of the pre-clinical and clinical trials by detailed references to published scientific literature if it can be demonstrated that the active substances of a medicinal product in the claimed therapeutic indication and (for veterinary products) target species have been in well-established use within the Union (EEA) for at least ten years, with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. In this regard, the provisions of Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC or Annex I of Directive 2001/82/EC shall apply
Data sourced from the UK, while the UK was a Member State of the Union, can be taken into account to demonstrate that the active substances of a medicinal product in the claimed therapeutic indication and (for veterinary products) target species have been in well-established use within the Union (EEA) for at least ten years, with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety.

15. Union affect traditional herbal medicinal products (traditional-use registration)?
for medicines for human use)
The traditional-use registration procedure allows the registration of herbal medicinal products without requiring particulars and documents on tests and trials on safety and efficacy, provided that there is sufficient evidence of the medicinal use of the product throughout a period of at least 30 years, including at least 15 years in the Union (EEA)
Data sourced from the UK, while the UK was a Member State of the Union, can be taken into account to demonstrate that the product has been in medicinal use throughout a period of at least 15 years within the Union (EEA)
16. How does Union affect the prevalence for orphan drug designation?
for medicines for human use)  For applications for orphan designation
or for its maintenance submitted after 29 March 2019, patients in the UK should no longer be taken into account in the calculation of the prevalence of the disease in order to meet the requirements for orphan drug designation as set out in Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 i.e. a condition affecting no more than 5 in 10 thousand persons in the Union (EEA)
located in the UK, if also nominated for Member States other than the UK?  The local representative mentioned in the product information should be located in the Union (EEA). Therefore, any local representative located in the UK and nominated for Member States other than the UK will have to be changed to a local representative located in the Union (EEA).  The corresponding amendments to labelling and package leaflet must be fully completed and implemented by the marketing authorisation holder before 30 March 2019, either as part of a regulatory procedure affecting the annexes (e.g. variation, renewal), or through a notification under an Article 61(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC or (for veterinary products) through a Type IAIN variation (see Variation Guideline (2013/ C 223/01), classification C.II.6.a). 17a. Union affect the local representative for UK mentioned in the product information?  After 29 March 2019, the mentioning of the local representative for UK in the product information will become obsolete.
he deletion of the local representative for UK in the product information will need to be incorporated as part of a future regulatory procedure affecting the annexes (e.g. variation, renewal) and the earliest opportunity after 29 March 2019 should be used
18.
affect
he sunset clause?  According to Article 24(4) to (6) of Directive 2001/83/EC, Article 28(4) to (6) of Directive 2001/82/EC and Articles 14(4) to (6) and 39(4) to (6) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 any authorisation which within three years of its granting is not followed by the actual placing on the market of the authorised product in the authorising Member State or on the Union market will cease to be valid. When an authorised product previously placed on the market in the authorising Member State or in the Union is no longer actually present on the market for a period of three consecutive years, the authorisation for that product will cease to be valid.  In case a centrally authorised medicinal product has only been marketed in the UK, the placing on the UK market, while UK was a Member State of the Union
will be taken into account to determine the applicability of the sunset clause for the medicinal product concerned. In this respect, if after the UK withdrawal from the Union
the medicinal product is not placed on any other market of the
remaining Member States, the three year period for the sunset clause will start running from the last date the medicinal product was placed on the UK market
while UK was a Member State of the Union.
19. What if my product is subject to Official Control Authority Batch Release (OCABR) and is currently tested by a UK Official Medicines Control Laboratory (OMCL)?
According to Article 114 of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 82 of Directive 2001/82/EC, Member States may require the marketing authorisation holder of a human immunological medicinal product or a medicinal product derived from human blood or plasma or immunological veterinary medicinal product to submit samples from each batch of the bulk and/or the medicinal product for examination by an Official Medicines Control Laboratory (OMCL) or a laboratory that a Member State has designated for that purpose before the release on the market. This is referred to as Official Control Authority Batch Release (OCABR). According to the EU Administrative Procedure for Official Control Authority Batch Release10, prior to marketing in the Union (EEA), batches of medicinal products subject to independent testing should obtain an Official Control Authority Batch Release Certificate common to all Member States. This shall demonstrate that the batch of medicinal product has been examined and tested by an OMCL within the Union (EEA) in accordance with this procedure and with Official Control Authority Batch Release guidelines pertaining to the medicinal product and that it is in compliance with the approved specifications laid down in the relevant monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) and in the relevant marketing authorisation
For products placed on the market as of the withdrawal date,11 OCABR cannot be carried out by an OMCL located in the UK. OCABR will need to be carried out by an OMCL located within the Union (EEA) or by a country officially recognised by the Union for mutual recognition of batch release. The marketing authorisation holder will therefore need to identify a OMCL located in the Union (EEA) for official batch release or an officially recognised partner (as stated above) for official batch release. A list of the OMCLs that may be in a position to provide the Union OCABR certificates for different products is available to manufacturers from the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & Healthcare
EDQM
on request at batchrelease@edqm.eu
19a. Can I, as of the withdrawal date, import a medicinal product into the Union (EEA) on the basis of a certificate issued before the withdrawal date by the UK OMCL? (NEW) No. As of the withdrawal date, the mutual recognition of Official Control Authority Batch Release (OCABR) stops.  However, the Official Medicines Control Laboratory (OMCL) of an EU27 or EEA Member State may take account of the certificate issued by the UK OMCL when issuing a certificate.

For goods placed on the EU market before the withdrawal date, the EU is trying to agree solutions with the United Kingdom in the withdrawal agreement. The essential principles of the EU's position on goods placed on the market under Union law before the withdrawal date are available here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/position-paper-goods-placed-market-under-union-law-withdrawal-date_en
The concept of placing on the market refers to each individual product, not to a type of product, irrespectively of whether it was manufactured as an individual unit or in series

19b. Does the change of the marketing authorisation holder due to the UK's withdrawal impact on the validity of the Official Control Authority Batch Release issued by a Official Medicines Control Laboratory (OMCL) of an EU27 or EEA Member State? (NEW) No. The Official Control Authority Batch Release (OCABR) of the OMCL of an EU27 or EEA Member State remains valid even if the marketing authorisation holder changes.  20. What if my product is subject to Official Batch Protocol Review (OBPR) and evaluation is done by a UK Competent Authority? (for veterinary medicines
According to Article 81 of Directive 2001/82/EC Member States may require the marketing authorisation holder for immunological veterinary medicinal products to submit to the competent authorities copies of all the control reports signed by the qualified person in accordance with Article 55 of Directive 2001/82/EC in order to verify that control tests were carried out in accordance with the methods laid down for the purposes of marketing authorisation. This is referred to as an 'Official Batch Protocol Review' (OBPR). OBPR may be carried out by a Competent Authority within the Union (EEA) or in a country officially recognised by the Union for mutual recognition of batch release (e.g. Switzerland)
For products placed on the market as of the withdrawal date,12 OBPR cannot be carried out by a UK Competent Authority. The marketing authorisation holder will therefore need to identify another Competent Authority located in the Union (EEA) or an officially recognised partner (as stated above) for official batch protocol review.
1hdrawal from the Union affect the status of inspection outcomes by the UK competent authority?  It is expected that findings of inspections, in particular to determine compliance with good manufacturing practice, good clinical practice and pharmacovigilance obligations, conducted by the UK competent authority before 30 March 2019 are implemented by the inspected entities in accordance with the applicable legislation, in particular Directive 2003/94/EC, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1252/2014 and Directive 91/412/EEC with regard to good manufacturing practice, Directive 2001/20/EC and Commission Directive 2005/28/EC with regard to good clinical practice and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004
Directive 2001/83/EC and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 with regard to pharmacovigilance obligations
22devices by UK notified bodies?  This issue is addressed in the Commission Notice on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in the field of industrial products that also covers medical devices.

For goods placed on the EU market before the withdrawal date, the EU is trying to agree solutions with the United Kingdom in the withdrawal agreement. The essential principles of the EU's position on goods placed on the market under Union law before the withdrawal date are available here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/position-paper-goods-placed-market-under-union-law-withdrawal-date_en
The concept of placing on the market refers to each individual product, not to a type of product, irrespectively of whether it was manufactured as an individual unit or in series


opinion for ancillary medicinal substances in medical devices requested by UK notified bodies?
According to Article 1(4) of Directive 93/42/EEC where a device incorporates, as an integral part, a substance which, if used separately, may be considered to be a medicinal product within the meaning of Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC and which is liable to act upon the body with action ancillary to that of the device, that device shall be assessed and authorized in accordance with Directive 93/42/EEC
In accordance with Annex I of Directive 93/42/EEC for a new medical device, the notified body acts as the applicant in an initial consultation procedure with EMA concerning the scientific opinion on the ancillary medicinal substances incorporated in the medical devices.  Union product legislation requires Notified Bodies to be established in a Member State and be designated by a Member State notifying authority. From the withdrawal date, UK notified bodies will lose their status as the Union notified bodies. They will no longer be able to be an applicant in an initial consultation procedure with EMA and EMA will not be able to issue a scientific opinion to them as notified bodies of a third country. 24. market a multi-country pack which includes the UK
Multi-country packs are medicinal products that are labelled to allow their placing on the market in several Member States with the same packaging. This possibility is subject to the requirements set out in Directive 2001/83/EC in Title V or Directive 2001/82/EC in Title V and requires that the summary of product characteristics is the same in all the markets concerned.  (NEW) Article
57 and 62 of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article
58 and 63 of Directive 2001/82/EC allow Member States to require inclusion of certain additional labelling information in
restricted area (the so-called "blue box") provided that all the strict conditions for the application of Article 57 or Article 62 of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 58 or Article 63 of Directive 2001/82/EC are fulfilled.  In applying these provisions, multi-country packs with the UK market are only possible if
the product information is exactly the same in the United Kingdom as in the EU27 (EEA); and
the Member State has allowed additional information labelled in the "blue box". This additional information must be limited to certain administrative information.
n any event the product labelling and package leaflet must be fully in line with the summary of product characteristics as authorised in the Union (EEA)
-up arrangements are in the UK?  According to Article 2 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 back-up arrangements shall apply in the absence of the QPPV. As the tasks of QPPV need to be carried in a Member State of the Union (EEA), the back-up arrangements for cases of absence of the QPPV, which replace such tasks, also need to be performed in the Union (EEA). Where a MAH relies on the services of a deputy QPPV as part of its back-up arrangements in the absence of the QPPV, those arrangements should ensure that the deputy QPPV is established and performs his/her tasks in the Union (EEA). For veterinary medicines, reference is made to the EMA Brexit practical guidance.

26. Who will take over supervision of the manufacturing sites of medicinal products in third countries (including UK after the Withdrawal date) previously supervised by UK authorities and when will the next GMP inspection be conducted? (NEW) According to Articles 18 and 43 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, in case of medicinal products imported from third countries the supervisory authorities shall be the competent authorities of the Member State or Member States that granted the authorisation provided for in Article 40(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC or Article 44(3) of Directive 2001/82/EC respectively to the importer of the concerned medicinal product.
As of the withdrawal date, UK authorities will no longer undertake the role of a supervisory authority. The new Union supervisory authority responsible for supervision of manufacturing sites located in UK and third country sites previously inspected by UK will decide, using a risk-based approach, when an inspection of the site(s) concerned will be required, in order to confirm or re-confirm GMP compliance.  27. Can I continue to use after 29 March 2019 a manufacturing site for which the Union GMP certificate has been issued by UK authorities?(NEW) All medicinal products for human and veterinary use manufactured or imported into the Union (EEA), including medicinal products intended for export, are to be manufactured in accordance with the principles and guidelines of good manufacturing practice.13 14 A certificate of good manufacturing practice inspection shows that the manufacturer complies with the principles and guidelines of good manufacturing practice as provided for by the Union legislation.15 16
While the Union legislation does not require a Union GMP certificate issued by a Member State for issuing a marketing authorisation17 or importation of a medicinal product,18 in practice GMP certificates issued by the Union competent authorities are used to confirm the Union GMP compliance in regulatory submissions (e.g. marketing authorisation applications) and for imports from third countries. This means that GMP compliance of manufacturing sites in third countries may also be confirmed through other means, based on a risk
ased approach (e.g. based on information on GMP compliance from third country regulatory authorities). GMP certificates issued by the UK competent authority before 30 March 201
should therefore be considered as such information on GMP compliance from the third country regulatory authority. 28. Shall the information about the unique identifier uploaded to the UK repository between 9 February 2019 and 29 March 2019 be transferred to another repository in the Union? (for medicines for human use)(NEW) Article 33(1) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/161 requires marketing authorisation holders to ensure that unique identifiers and related information are uploaded to the Union repository system before a product is released for sale or distribution. Any information uploaded to the Union hub or a national repository should be transferred and stored in all national or
13 Commission Directive 2003/94/EC, Recital (1). 14 Commission Directive 91/412/EEC. 15 Directive 2001/83/EC, Article 111(5). 16 Directive 2001/82/EC, Article 80(5). 17 Article 8(3)(ha) of Directive 2001/83/EC
18 Article 51(1)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC, Article 55(1)(b) of Directive 2001/82/EC

supranational repositories serving the territory of Member State(s) where the product is intended to be placed on market. Therefore, the information on products released on the market before the withdrawal date will be already present in the national repositories where the product is intended to be placed on the market and there is no need to transfer information from the UK repository
29. Can activities related to safety features take place in the UK? (for medicines for human use)(NEW) The manufacturer placing the safety features, as referred to in Articles 14 and 15 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/161, is the manufacturer actually affixing the unique identifier and anti-tampering device on the packaging. There is no requirement that such a manufacturer has to be located in the Union (EEA). However, if a manufacturer is not in the Union (EEA), then the obligation to ensure that Articles 14 and 15 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/161 are complied with lies with the importer. The Qualified Person at the batch release site in the Union (EEA) will have to ensure that the safety features have been affixed to the packaging (Article 51(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC). This task may be delegated to appropriately trained personnel or third parties, as set out in Annex 16 to the EU GMP guidelines (section 1.7). For general GMP requirements on outsourced activities, refer to Chapter 7 of the EU GMP guidelines
The responsibility for ensuring that the information is uploaded in the repositories system lies with the MAH (or the person responsible for placing on the market medicinal products which are parallel distributed/parallel imported). Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/161 does not prohibit MAHs from subcontracting or delegating data-upload tasks to on-boarding partners (OBPs) acting on their behalf. However, the infrastructures, hardware and software used for data upload must be physically located in the EEA (see question 7.19 in Questions and Answers on Safety Features for Medicinal Products for Human Use). 30. Can parallel trade of medicinal products sourced in the UK and supplied to the EU(27) or EEA continue as of the withdrawal date?(NEW) Parallel trade of medicinal products in the internal market is possible in particular because of (i) the rules in the internal market for the exhaustion of trade mark rights; and (ii) the fact that the summary of product characteristics and the labelling of medicinal products are  apart from issues of language used  identical. As of the withdrawal date, the rules for exhaustion of trade mark rights in the Union (EEA) no longer apply in respect of products placed on the UK market. Moreover, the terms of the marketing authorisation will over time differ.19 Hence, parallel trade of medicines sourced in the UK is in practice no longer possible as of the withdrawal date. However, from the point of view of Union pharmaceutical law, medicines that have been sourced in the UK, and brought into the territory of the EU27 (EEA) before the withdrawal date can continue to circulate on the EU27 (EEA) market if they are authorise

19
To this may add national rules on parallel trade of medicinal products with third countries.

31. Does, as of the withdrawal date, Article 76(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 57(1)(o) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 continue to apply to parallel trade of medicinal products sourced in the UK?(NEW) Article 76(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 57(1)(o) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 address the distribution of a centrally authorised medicinal product from one Member State to another by a pharmaceutical company independent of the marketing-; in the context of this legislation, this notion nationally authorised products).  It does not cover export or import of the product from third countries. Moreover, as of the withdrawal date, central marketing authorisations cease to be valid in the UK. As of the withdrawal date, Article 76(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 57(1)(o) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 no longer appl
to medicinal products sourced in the UK for the purpose of parallel distribution in EU27 (EEA)
However, it is recalled that, as set out in the previous Q&A pair, parallel trade of medicinal products sourced in the United Kingdom will anyhow no longer be possible as of the withdrawal date. 32. Will parallel distribution notices under Article 76(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 57(1)(o) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 with UK as the Member State of destination remain valid as of the withdrawal date?(NEW) Article 76(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 57(1)(o) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 address the sourcing of centrally authorised medicinal products in Member States and their distribution in other Member States (to be distinguished from parallel imports of nationally authorised products). It does not cover export or import of the product from third countries. Moreover, as of the withdrawal date, central marketing authorisations cease to be valid in the UK. Therefore, as of the withdrawal date, notices with the UK as the only destination country will become obsolete, whereas, notices with several destination countries will remain valid with respect to EU27 destination countries. 33. Will parallel distribution notices under Article 76(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 57(1)(o) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for a parallel distributor located in UK remain valid as of the withdrawal date?(NEW) Article 76(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 57(1)(o) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 address the sourcing of centrally authorised medicinal products in Member States and their distribution in other Member States (to be distinguished from parallel imports of nationally authorised products). It does not cover export or import of the product from third countries. Moreover, as of the withdrawal date, central marketing authorisations cease to be valid in the UK. Therefore, as of the withdrawal date, notices to distributors in the UK will become obsolete
Please note that the transfer of parallel distribution notices to another entity is not foreseen and a change of address is possible only in case the legal entity remains the same. 34. Will parallel distribution notices under Article 76(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 57(1)(o) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 with a re-packaging site located in UK remain valid as of the withdrawal date?(NEW) Article 76(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 57(1)(o) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 address the sourcing of centrally authorised medicinal products in Member States and their distribution in other Member States (to be distinguished from parallel imports of nationally authorised products).  It does not cover export or import of the product from third countries. Therefore as of the withdrawal date the UK sites will have to have been removed, in order for these notices to remain valid as of the withdrawal date

35. What will change regarding reporting requirements into EudraVigilance of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) from the UK? (for medicines for human use) (NEW) According to Article 107 of Directive 2001/83/EC suspected serious adverse reactions have to be reported no matter if they occurred in the Union (EEA) or in third countries.
uspected non-serious adverse reactions occurring in third countries do not have to be reported in the Union (EEA). Thus, as of the withdrawal date
non-serious adverse reactions that have occurred in the UK before the withdrawal date have to be reported;
it is no longer mandatory to submit to EudraVigilance reports of suspected non-serious adverse reactions that have occurred in the UK as of the withdrawal date
For individual cases originating from UK and submitted to EudraVigilance before the withdrawal date, when a follow-up information is received by the marketing authorisation holder as of the withdrawal date, it should be continued to be submitted to EudraVigilance when third country reporting criteria apply. As of the withdrawal date, UK authorities will no longer have access to EudraVigilance. Marketing authorisation holders are therefore reminded that they will need to submit into EudraViglance information that they might receive from UK authorities regarding cases occurring in the UK, in line with the reporting requirements for non-EU/EEA cases.  Referral procedures ongoing on the withdrawal date will continue, irrespective of the Member State that triggered the referral, with the exception of MRP/DCP referral procedures on applications with UK as the reference member state20.  As of the withdrawal date, UK products will formally no longer be part of Union referral procedures. As a consequence, as of the withdrawal date assessment reports will no longer be shared with marketing authorisation holders/applicants for UK products that were previously concerned by the referral procedure. Nevertheless, all data submitted in the referral procedure, including data submitted on UK products before the withdrawal date, will be taken into account during the assessment. A scientific opinion issued as of the withdrawal date, as well as Commission Decisions adopted as of the withdrawal date, will not include UK products. The Commission Decision will only be addressed to the EU27 (EEA) Member States.
20 As stated in question 1b of the Questions and Answers published by the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures
Human and  Questions and Answers published by the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures  Veterinary http://www.hma.eu/fileadmin/dateien/Veterinary_medicines/CMDv_Website/Brexit/QAs_UK_withdrawal_from_EU_national_authorised_medicinal_products.pdf, with regards to MRP/DCP procedures with UK as the before 30 March 2019 (i.e. agreement of the concerned Member States [..] or decision of the Commission [..]) the procedure is stopped and the applicant needs to submit a new application to a new Reference Member not continue after 29 March 2019.

The fees for referrals are determined at the start date of procedure. For medicinal products for human use the fees for Pharmacovigilance referrals are calculated based on products authorised in the Union (EEA) (as recorded in 'Article 57 database') at that time. Until the withdrawal date this includes UK nationally approved products. 37. How do I handle, as of the withdrawal date, data from UK in the Periodic Safety Update Reports? (NEW) Periodic safety update reports (PSURs) should present cumulative and interval summaries of global safety data obtained from various sources worldwide. Relevant safety data obtained from UK sources as of the withdrawal date should therefore continue to be included in PSURs as per usual requirements for third country data. For the calculation of exposure from marketing experience by region, patients exposed in the UK until the withdrawal date should be included in the EU/EEA estimate. Thereafter, UK patient exposure should be considered as part of the non-EU/EEA regions.

OTICE TO STAKEHOLDERS
ITHDRAWAL OF THE
NITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES ON PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS
The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for European and national authorities, but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, business operators involved in the activities falling under the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides (MRLs), including applicants for an active substance or plant protection product
are reminded of certain legal repercussions stemming from currently applicable rules of Union law
which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of plant protection products and pesticides no longer apply to the United Kingdom
In particular, business operators should consider that, according to Union law, third countries cannot act as rapporteur Member States, zonal rapporteur Member State
or evaluating Member State
for MRLs

Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU
4
With the exception of contracting states of the European Economic Area ("EEA").
2 Concerning submissions of new applications
business operators should take into account the expected timelines of different regulatory procedures in which the United Kingdom would be acting as
for example
rapporteur Member State, zonal rapporteur Member State or evaluating Member State for MRLs. Taking account of the aforementioned uncertainties as well as the regulatory framework, business operators should consider taking the relevant actions. For example, where there is a risk that those procedures are not concluded by the date when the United Kingdom will leave the Union, applicants may choose by preference another Member State to carry out the evaluation or assessment. Concerning those on-going procedures for which the United Kingdom is currently carrying out an assessment or evaluation, business operators should carefully monitor their progress.  Where there are clear indications that the procedure will not be concluded by the withdrawal date, taking account of the uncertainties as well as the regulatory framework, business operators should consider taking the necessary actions. For example, a change of rapporteur or evaluating Member State may be required.  The Commission services is working with Members States and EEA countries to establish a coordinated way forward for the timely communication, agreement and technical transfer of the file in case change is needed. This will be particularly relevant for the review programme of existing active substances, for which the United Kingdom was assigned by law (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 686/2012) as rapporteur and co-rapporteur Member State. The website of the Commission on approval of active substances (http://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/pesticides/approval_active_substances_en)  provide
general information concerning the approval of active substances as well as a series of Questions & Answers (Q&A) in relation to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 and Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. These page

UESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATED TO THE UNITED KINGDOM
WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH REGARD TO PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS AND PESTICIDES RESIDUES On 23 January 2018, the European Commission services published a "Notice to stakeholders  withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules on plant protection products".
This list of Questions and Answers (Q&A pairs) which has been drafted by the European Commission services, aims at giving further guidance on the basis of the above-mentioned notice to stakeholders. The list of Q&A pairs will be further updated and complemented when necessary. The new text introduced in this version of Q&As "Rev2" is indicated by the word "NEW". This list of Q&As addresses a situation where the United Kingdom becomes a third country on 30 March 2019 ("the withdrawal date") without a withdrawal agreement and hence without a transition period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement
GENERAL 1. What if my company is established in the United Kingdom and it is the holder of a PPP authorisation in a Member State? Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market
("the PPP Regulation") does not require applicants for authorisations for plant protection products ("PPP") and authorisation holders to be established in the European Union. Therefore, no action needs to be taken in this respect.   2. What if my company is an applicant for approval of a substance, or for the setting/modification/deletion/review of a MRL and it is established in the United Kingdom

This notice replaced the notice of 26 September 2017.

("the MRL Regulation
do not require applicants for approval of active substances and applicants for MRLs to be established in the European Union. Therefore, no action needs to be taken in this respect.   3. What if the manufacturing site of my active substance is located in the United Kingdom
The PPP Regulation and MRL Regulation do not set any specific requirement regarding the location of the manufacturing site(s) of active substances, which can be manufactured in third countries. Therefore, no action needs to be taken in this respect. However, after the withdrawal date the substance will be imported from a third country and will be subject to any applicable EU law in this respect (e.g. administrative formalities linked to the introduction into the customs territory of the EU).   4. What if the manufacturing site of my PPP is located in the United Kingdom
The PPP Regulation and MRL Regulation does not set any specific requirement regarding the location of the manufacturing site(s) of PPP, which can be manufactured in third countries. Therefore, no action needs to be taken in this respect by authorisation holders. However, after the withdrawal date PPP will be imported from a third country and will be subject to any applicable EU law in this respect (e.g. administrative formalities linked to the introduction into the customs territory of the EU).
EW APPLICATIONS  5. What if my company is considering submitting a new application for an active substance for which the United Kingdom could be the rapporteur Member State (RMS)? What if my company wishes to apply for an amendment to the approval of an active substance under Article 7 of the PPP Regulation for which the United Kingdom has been the RMS? Until the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom remains a member of the European Union, with all the rights and obligations that derive from its membership, including the principle of sincere cooperation which states that the Union and all its Member States shall assist each other in carrying out the Treaty. Thus, the United Kingdom can still be chosen as RMS. However, as of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom can no longer act as a RMS. This also applies if the
ithdrawal Agreement is concluded: during the transition period, the United Kingdom cannot act as RMS.
Applicants should take this into account when choosing the RMS: Choosing the United Kingdom means that the file would need to be handed over to another Member State taking up the role as RMS before the withdrawal date

See Article 128
) of the Withdrawal Agreement
3 6. What if my company is considering submitting a new application for a PPP or for MRLs for which the United Kingdom could be the zonal rapporteur Member State (zRMS) or the Evaluating Member State (EMS)
Until the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom remains a member of the European Union, with all the rights and obligations that derive from its membership, including the principle of sincere cooperation which states that the Union and all its Member States shall assist each other in carrying out the Treaty. Thus, the United Kingdom can still be chosen as zRMS or as Evaluating Member State for MRLs. However, as of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom can no longer act as a zRMS or as EMS. This also applies if the
ithdrawal Agreement is concluded: during the transition period, the United Kingdom cannot act as zRMS or Evaluating Member State for MRLs.
Applicants should take this into account.  In the context of an application for authorisation or renewal of authorisation of a PPP, the evaluation by the zRMS is considered completed, when the assessment pursuant to Article 36(1) or Article 43 of the PPP Regulation is made available to the concerned Member States within the same zone
In the context of an application for MRLs, the evaluation by the EMS is considered completed, when the evaluation report is made available to the Commission pursuant to Article 9(1) of the MRL Regulation
APPLICATIONS FOR RENEWAL OF THE APPROVAL OF AN ACTIVE SUBSTANCE 7. What if the United Kingdom was designated as RMS or Co-RMS under Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 686/2012 and my company needs to submit an application for renewal of the approval of an active substance?  Until the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom remains a member of the European Union, with all the rights and obligations that derive from membership, including the principle of sincere cooperation which states that the Union and all its Member States shall assist each other in carrying out the Treaty. Thus, the United Kingdom can still act as RMS or Co-RMS under the renewal procedure. However, as of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom can no longer act as a RMS or Co-RMS. This also applies if the
ithdrawal Agreement is concluded: during the transition period, the United Kingdom cannot act as RMS or Co-RMS.

N-GOING ASSESSMENTS 8. What if the United Kingdom is RMS for the assessment of the application for approval of my substance or application for an amendment to the approval, or for the assessment of confirmatory information (Article 13(3) of the PPP Regulation), and my dossier is already submitted to the United Kingdom? What will happen with the on-going evaluation of my application for approval?  As of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom can no longer act as a RMS. This also applies if the
ithdrawal Agreement is concluded: during the transition period, the United Kingdom cannot act as RMS.
While the Withdrawal Agreement provides for the transfer of files and documents relating to ongoing procedures,10 stakeholders are strongly advised to carefully monitor progress of on-going assessments. The Commission services are currently working with Member States and EEA countries in order to establish a coordinated way forward for a timely communication and technical transfer of the files concerned. 9. What if the United Kingdom was designated as RMS under Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 686/201211 and my supplementary dossier is already submitted to the United Kingdom? What will happen with the ongoing evaluation of my application for the renewal of approval?
s of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom can no longer act as a RMS. This also applies if the
ithdrawal Agreement is concluded: during the transition period, the United Kingdom cannot act as RMS.12 The Withdrawal Agreement provides for the transfer of files and documents relating to ongoing procedures. (NEW) The Commission has adopted an amendment to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 686/2012 to allocate the role of RMS to an EU-27 Member State.13 Commission services continue to assess whether additional re-allocations are necessary.
10. Is the new RMS entitled to require fees or charges and if so, to what extent
(NEW) The new RMS who has agreed to take over files from the UK is entitled, in accordance with Article 7
of the PPP Regulation and Article 42 of the MRL Regulation to recover costs of work carried out under these Regulations. The conditions set out in Article 74 of the PPP Regulation and Article 42 of the MRL Regulation apply.

hat if the United Kingdom is zRMS for the assessment of the application of an authorisation or the renewal of an authorisation for a PPP, or EMS for an application for a MRL? What will happen with the ongoing evaluation of my application for PPP authorisation or the MRL?   As of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom can no longer act as a zRMS or EMS. This also applies if the
ithdrawal Agreement is concluded: during the transition period, the United Kingdom cannot act as zRMS or EMS.14 Concerning procedures that are ongoing on the withdrawal date and for which the United Kingdom is acting as zRMS for the assessment of the application of an authorisation or the renewal of an authorisation for a PPP, or EMS for an application for a MRL
the zRMS or EMS will need to be changed.  For evaluations of PPP applications ongoing on the withdrawal date, the Withdrawal Agreement provides for the transfer of files and documents relating to ongoing procedures.15 The Commission Services work with Members States and the Zonal Steering Committees in order to establish a coordinated way forward for a timely communication and technical transfer of the file. Please see also Question 11 for more details regarding the granting of authorisations by other Member States for plant protection product assessed by the United Kingdom as zRMS.
or ongoing MRL applications, the new EMS will carry on with the evaluation in accordance with Article 8 of the MRL Regulation or, where that evaluation is considered completed by the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date (see Question 6), perform the assessment of supplementary information potentially requested by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 11(2) of the MRL Regulation.
ONCLUDED ASSESSMENTS 12.
hat if an EU Member State wants to make a decision on an authorisation for a PPP based on an assessment concluded by the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date?
ntil the withdrawal date the United Kingdom may act as zRMS, whereas the other Member States act as Member States concerned (cMS).16 The zonal assessment process is a collaborative process involving also scrutiny of the application by all the cMS and established in a harmonised format (Article 36(1) of the PPP Regulation). When the assessment by the United Kingdom is completed, i.e. made available to the other Member States in accordance with Article 36(1) of the PPP Regulation and the United Kingdom has issued its national authorisation before the withdrawal date, other Member States will have to decide, within 120 days, on                                                  14

See Article 4
of the Withdrawal Agreement
16
This system applies for the first authorisation of a plant protection product in one zone or, through the reference of Article 43(3) of the PPP Regulation, also for applications for renewals
6 the application in accordance with Article 37(4) and 36(2) of the PPP Regulation on the basis of the assessment carried out and completed by the United Kingdom.  However, whe
the assessment by the United Kingdom is completed, i.e. made available to the other Member States in accordance with Article 36(1) of the PPP Regulation, but the United Kingdom has not issued its national authorisation prior to the withdrawal date, there is no authorisation granted prior to the withdrawal date, which (in addition to the assessment) is needed to trigger the 120-days deadline for the authorisation decision by a cMS (Article 37(4) of the PPP Regulation). Therefore, the authorisation that would have been issued by the original zRMS has to be substituted in that case by one of the cMS. This cMS will issue such authorisation on the basis of the assessment concluded by the United Kingdom
Business operators finding themselves in this situation will have to approach one or more of the cMS with the relevant request  cMS could then agree appropriate arrangements in the respective Zonal Steering Committee.
UTUAL RECOGNITION OF AUTHORISATIONS 13.
hat if my company wishes to obtain after the United Kingdom withdrawal an authorisation in an EU Member State of the same zone or another zone by mutual recognition in accordance with Article 40 of the PPP Regulation on the basis of an authorisation that was granted by the United Kingdom?   As of the withdrawal date, an EU-27 Member State of the same zone or another zone (in accordance with Article 40(1)(b) and (c) of the PPP Regulation) can no longer recognise an authorisation which was issued by the United Kingdom
This also applies if the
ithdrawal Agreement is concluded: during the transition period, the United Kingdom cannot be a reference Member State in the mutual recognition procedure.17 Business operators will need to (re-)apply for an authorisation based on an existing product authorisation in another EU-27 Member State. However, where an authorisation by an EU-27 Member State has been granted under the mutual recognition procedure before the withdrawal date, this authorisation is not affected by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom.
ARALLEL TRADE PERMIT
14. Are parallel trade permit
(Article 52 of the PPP Regulation
granted by an EU-27 Member State valid as of the withdrawal date for plant protection products of which the United Kingdom was the Member State of origin? (NEW) Article 52 of the PPP Regulation provides for issuance of parallel trade permit
for parallel trade between Member States. As of the withdrawal date, a parallel trade permit issued by an EU-27 Member State prior to the withdrawal date for a plant protection product of which the United Kingdom was the Member State of origin is no longer valid18
Plant protection products benefiting from such parallel trade permit can therefore no longer be placed on the market in the particular                                                  17
See Article 128
) of the Withdrawal Agreement
18
A condition for granting a parallel trade permit under Article 52 is that it is granted to a product that is identical to a plant protection product authorised in a
EU Member State (Member State of Origin).

ITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES ON BIOCIDAL PRODUCTS
The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that unless the withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law ceases to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ("the withdrawal date"). The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'. Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for European and national authorities, but also for private parties. In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, business operators involved in the activities falling under the scope of Regulation (EC) No 528/2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products are reminded of certain legal repercussions stemming from currently applicable rules of Union law which need to be considered when  the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of biocidal products no longer apply to the United Kingdom. In particular, b

Taking account of these uncertainties as well as the regulatory framework, business operators should consider taking the relevant actions. For example, where there is a risk that those procedures are not concluded by the date that the United Kingdom leave

UESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATED TO THE UNITED KINGDOM'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH REGARD TO THE BIOCIDES SECTOR On 23 January 2018, the European Commission services published a "Notice to stakeholders  withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules on biocidal products".
This notice recalled the following:
The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that unless the withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law ceases to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ("the withdrawal date").

In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, business operators involved in the activities falling under the scope of Regulation (EC) No 528/2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products are reminded of certain legal repercussions stemming from currently applicable rules of Union law which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of biocidal products no longer apply to the United Kingdom. In particular, business operators should consider that, according to Union law, third countries cannot act as evaluating Member States or reference Member States
" This list of Questions and Answers (Q&A pairs) which has been drafted by the European Commission services aims at giving further guidance on the basis of the above-mentioned notice to stakeholders. The list of Q&A pairs will be further updated and complemented when necessary.
This notice replaced the notice of 13 September 2017.
Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
With the exception of contracting States of the European Economic Area ("EEA countries") and Switzerland.
GENERAL 1. My company is currently considering submitting an application under the Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products4, for which the UK authorities could act as evaluating Competent Authority (eCA) or reference Member State (refMS). How should we proceed? Until the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom remains a member of the European Union, with all the rights and obligations that derive from membership. Thus, you may still choose the United Kingdom as eCA/refMS.  However, as of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom can no longer act as a eCA/refMS. This also applies if a withdrawal agreement is concluded since the United Kingdom cannot act as eCA/refMS during the transition period
Applicants should take this into account when choosing the United Kingdom as their eCA/refMS as it also implies that the file would need to be handed over to another Member State taking up the role as eCA/refMS before the withdrawal date. 2. Currently, the United Kingdom is acting as evaluating Competent Authority (eCA) or reference Member State (refMS) in an on-going regulatory procedure related to my company (e.g. active substance approval, renewal of an active substance approval, Union authorisation, simplified authorisation procedure, mutual recognition in parallel, renewal of product authorisations under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 492/2014
or applications for minor or major changes under Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 354/20137). What effect will the withdrawal of the United Kingdom have on the pending process? According to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, the role of evaluating Competent Authority (eCA) or reference Member State (refMS) is attributed to (the Competent Authority of) a Member State
However, as of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom can no longer act as a
eCA/refMS. This also applies if a withdrawal agreement is concluded since the United Kingdom cannot act as eCA/refMS during the transition period9.

Applicants in an ongoing procedure for which the United Kingdom is currently acting as eCA/refMS are advised to and to take the relevant actions. For example, if you see indications that the UK authority will not conclude the procedure by the withdrawal date, you may consider a transfer to another evaluating Member State.  The services of the European Commission and ECHA have been working with the EU-27 Member States, EEA countries and Switzerland to establish a coordinated approach to ensure a timely agreement and technical transfer of the file in case such a change is needed. The services of the European Commission and ECHA have already communicated some and will also communicate future transfers. This will be particularly relevant for the review programme of existing active substances for which the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1062/201410 assigned the United Kingdom as evaluating Member State (see more specific Q&A pairs below). 3. The manufacturing site of the active substance/biocidal product that my EU-27-based company is placing on the EU market is located in the United Kingdom. Do we need to be concerned about the withdrawal of the United Kingdom
Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 does not set any specific requirement regarding the location of the manufacturing site(s) of active substances or biocidal products. Therefore, manufacturing can take place in third countries. Therefore, in this regards you will not need to take any action to continue complying with Regulation (EU) No 528/2012. However, shipments to the EU of this active substance/biocidal product will be, as of the withdrawal date, importations, which may have consequences from the viewpoint of other sectorial legislation (e.g. the Regulation (EU) No 649/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 concerning the export and import of hazardous chemicals11, EU customs legislation, etc.).
4. Will ECHA still grant UK-based companies a right to refer to tests or studies on vertebrates that were submitted to ECHA or to a competent authority in connection with a previous application under Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 or Directive 98/8/EC12, also after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom
The data sharing mechanism under Articles 62 and 63 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 will still be available to such companies, for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012; for example, where a UK-based company intends to submit an application for active substance approval  and it requires vertebrate data for its application. In this connection, it should be stressed that it is a legal obligation for companies to make an inquiry to ECHA in the case of vertebrate data (see Article 62(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012).                                                            10

5. Will the substance or product-specific data owned by my UK-based company remain protected by the data protection rules of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom
Yes. Data protection applies to all information submitted for the purposes of the Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 or its predecessor, Directive 98/8/EC, under the conditions set out in the Regulation (EU) No 528/2012
ACTIVE SUBSTANCES 6. What effect will the withdrawal of the United Kingdom have with regard to active substances that were originally evaluated by the United Kingdom and subsequently approved by the European Commission? The withdrawal of the United Kingdom will not have any effect to the validity of the approval of these active substances. 7. My company needs to submit an application for renewal of an approval of our active substance for which the United Kingdom acted as the evaluating Competent Authority (eCA) during the first approval procedure. Considering that the United Kingdom can no longer, as of the withdrawal date, act as eCA, can my company choose another competent authority as eCA? Yes. Article 13(3) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 does not require that the eCA for the first approval shall be the eCA for the renewal, although it is usually recommended as a means to streamline the process. The mentioned provision requires that, when you submit your application for renewal, you shall indicate the name of the competent authority that you propose for evaluating your application for renewal and provide written confirmation that that competent authority agrees to do so.  The services of the European Commission have been working in a coordinated manner with EU-27 Members States, EEA countries and Switzerland in order to identify new eCAs for concerned active substances. The services of the European Commission have already informed the original participants in the review programme about the new eCAs. ECHA will also make this information publicly available in order to inform other prospective applicants (e.g. alternative suppliers). 8. What effect does the withdrawal of the United Kingdom have with regard to applications for approval of active substances, either within or outside the review programme, that are currently being assessed by the United Kingdom
As of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom can no longer act as the eCA. This also applies if a withdrawal agreement is concluded since the United Kingdom cannot act as eCA/refMS during the transition period.13

See Article 123(6) of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, as agreed between the EU and the United Kingdom at negotiator's level, which is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_agreement_coloured.pdf
5 The services of the European Commission have been working in a coordinated manner with EU-27 Members States, EEA countries and Switzerland in order to identify new eCAs for concerned existing active substances. The European Commission will adopt and publish, before the withdrawal date, an amendment to the Review Programme Regulation14 listing the existing active substances and the eCAs that will assess them. The name of the new eCAs has already been directly communicated to the participants in the review programme. The services of the European Commission have also identified new eCAs
or the assessment of pending applications for approval of those active substances that are not subject to the Review Programme Regulation (e.g. new active substances). The name of those eCAs has also been directly communicated to applicants and will be made known on the ECHA's website. 9. My UK-based company is listed as a supplier according to Article 95 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012. With a view to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom, what do I need to do? According to Article 95(1)  of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, substance or product suppliers listed in the Article 95 list must be established within the European Union. Therefore, you will need to appoint a representative established within the Union (or the EEA countries or Switzerland) and communicate this to ECHA (by request for correction15) in due time, so that the information on the list is updated before the withdrawal date. Otherwise, the UK supplier will be removed from the Article 95 list, and biocidal products from this source would no longer be allowed to be made available in the EU
10. I am a non-EU company and my EU representative for the purpose of Article 95 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 is established within the United Kingdom. With a view to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom, what do
need to do? According to Article 95(1)  of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, substance or product suppliers listed in the Article 95 list must be established within the European Union. Therefore, you will need to appoint a new representative established within the Union (or EEA countries or Switzerland) and communicate this to ECHA (by request for correction16) in due time, so that the information on the list is updated before the withdrawal date. 11. My EU-27-based company is listed under Article 95 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 as a supplier of a listed active substance for which we had purchased a letter of access (LoA) from a UK-based company. Will the withdrawal of the United Kingdom 95 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012
No. Data owners granting letters of access do not need to be EU-based.                                                              14

12. Will my UK-based company still be able to submit requests for active substance approval or inclusion of a substance on Annex I, after the withdrawal date
Yes, third country entities can undertake such submissions. Contrary to the case of a product authorisation, applicants for the approval of an active substance or Annex I inclusion are not "holders"/"owners" of an approval and they do not need to be established in the EU. However, you will have to get the agreement of an eCA from an EU-27 Member State
EEA country or Switzerland for the evaluation of the application.
IOCIDAL PRODUCTS 13. My UK-based company is the holder of a product authorisation in an EU-27 Member State or of a Union authorisation under Regulation (EU) No 528/2012. What effect will the withdrawal of the United Kingdom have on our authorisation? According to Article 3(1)(p) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, an authorisation holder must be established within the European Union. By virtue of the EEA Agreement as well as the Mutual Recognition Agreement with Switzerland, an authorisation holder can also be established in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland.  You will therefore need to transfer the authorisation to a new holder established within an EU-27 Member State or one of the afore-mentioned countries before the withdrawal date. You can trigger the amendment of your existing authorisation by means of an administrative change requiring prior notification before implementation (see point 3 in section 1 of Title I of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 354/2013). 14.
ill an EU-27 Member State, as of the withdrawal date, still be able to issue a national authorisation for a biocidal product on the basis of the mutual recognition in sequence of a UK authorisation? No. This will no longer be possible. 15. My company holds an authorisation issued by an EU-27 Member State prior to the UK withdrawal date on the basis of the mutual recognition of a UK authorisation. Will my authorisation in the EU-27 Member State be affected by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom?  No. The national authorisation granted by each EU-27 Member State will remain valid in that EU-27 Member State.  16. My company needs to apply for a change or renewal of a product authorisation granted in a mutual recognition procedure in which the United Kingdom acted as the reference Member State (refMS). Considering that, as of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom can no longer act as refMS, can my company choose another competent authority as refMS? Yes. Both Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 354/2013 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 492/2014 allow the authorisation holder to choose another refMS for the change as well as the renewal procedure.
You will, however, need to submit within the application a written confirmation that the new competent authority agrees to act as refMS. The services of the European Commission and ECHA have been working in a coordinated manner with EU-27 Members States, EEA countries and Switzerland in order to identify new refMS
for some products of the product-types 8 and 18 for which authorisation holders had to apply for renewal before the end of 2018. The name of those refMSs has been directly communicated to the relevant holders. 17. What is the effect of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom on ongoing applications for mutual recognition in parallel for which the United Kingdom is the reference Member State? As of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom can no longer act as reference Member State. This also applies if a withdrawal agreement is concluded since the United Kingdom cannot act as eCA/refMS during the transition period17.  Therefore, as set out in the Q&A pair No. 2, where the United Kingdom is currently acting as refMS, you are advised to carefully monitor the UK indications that the UK authority will not conclude the procedure by the withdrawal date, you may consider changing to another evaluating Member State. In this case, the new refMS will continue handling the relevant tasks referred to in Article 34 of the Regulation (EU) No 528/2012
The services of the European Commission and ECHA have been working in a coordinated manner with EU-27 Members States, EEA countries and Switzerland in order to identify new refMS
for some on-going applications. The name of those refMSs has been directly communicated to the relevant applicants
However, where no Member State takes over the role of refMS, there could be different consequences depending on the procedural stage at which the application is by the withdrawal date:
Where the United Kingdom as refMS has entered, before the withdrawal date, the elements referred to in Article 34(5) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 in the Register for Biocidal Products (R4BP) (i.e. the agreed summary of biocidal product characteristics (SPC) and the final assessment report, together with any agreed terms or conditions imposed on the making available on the market or use of the biocidal product), the cMSs may proceed to grant the national product authorisation in accordance with Article 34(6) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
Where the current refMS (i.e. the United Kingdom) has not entered, before the withdrawal
ate, in R4BP the above-mentioned elements
the applicant will need to submit a new application for mutual recognition in parallel to a new refMS of his choice and to the relevant cMSs in accordance with Article 34(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, respectively
17
See Article 123(6) of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, as agreed between the EU and the United Kingdom at negotiator's level, which is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_agreement_coloured.pdf
18. What is the effect of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom on ongoing applications for Union authorisation for which the United Kingdom is the evaluating Competent Authority? As of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom can no longer act as evaluating Competent Authority (eCA). This also applies if a withdrawal agreement is concluded since the United Kingdom cannot act as eCA/refMS during the transition period.18
Therefore, where the United Kingdom is currently acting as eCA, you are advised example, if you see indications that the UK authority will not conclude the procedure by the withdrawal date, you may consider changing to another eCA. In this case, the new eCA will continue handling the relevant tasks referred to in Article 44 of the Regulation (EU) No 528/2012. The services of the European Commission and ECHA have been working in a coordinated manner with EU-27 Members States, EEA countries and Switzerland in order to identify new eCA for some on-going applications. The name of those eCAs has been directly communicated to the relevant applicants. However, where no Member State takes over the role of eCA, there could be different consequences depending on the procedural stage at which the application is by the withdrawal date:
Where the peer review phase referred to in Article 44(3) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 has been concluded before the withdrawal date (i.e. ECHA has submitted the relevant opinion to the Commission, which includes the agreed summary of biocidal product characteristics (SPC), the final assessment report and any agreed terms or conditions imposed on the making available on the market or use of the biocidal product), the Commission may proceed to grant the Union authorisation in accordance with Article 44(5) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
Where the peer review phase referred to in Article 44(3) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 has not been concluded before the withdrawal date (i.e. ECHA has not submitted the relevant opinion to the Commission), the applicant will need to submit a new application for Union authorisation in accordance with Article 43(1) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012. 19. In case an application for mutual recognition in parallel or for Union authorisation is terminated and a new application has to be submitted, how would this affect the legal status of the existing products on the market with regard to Article 89(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012
With the submission of the initial application assessed by the United Kingdom the applicant fulfilled his legal obligation laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 89(3) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012. As a consequence, the existing                                                            18
See Article 123(6) of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, as agreed between the EU and the United Kingdom at negotiator's level, which is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_agreement_coloured.pdf
product(s) currently benefit from the provisions in Article 89(2) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012
Therefore, the above-mentioned existing product(s) could continue being made available on the market and used in accordance with the provisions of Article 89(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 provided that the applicant submits a new application for mutual recognition in parallel (to a new refMS of his choice and to the same Member States concerned in accordance with Article 34(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, respectively) or a new application for Union authorisation in accordance with Article 43(1) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, before the withdrawal date.  20. My company handles a low risk biocidal product, authorised in the United Kingdom via the simplified procedure. May we notify the placing on the market of that product to EU-27 countries after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom
No. After the withdrawal date the authorisation granted by the United Kingdom ceases to be valid with regard to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012. As a result, the right of the authorisation holder to make the product available on the market of the notified Member States pursuant to Article 27(1) of the Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 also ceases. Therefore, your company will need to obtain a new authorisation of the product via the simplified procedure from an EU-27 Member State, an EEA country or Switzerland prior to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom
21. My company notified to a number of Member States under Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 a low risk biocidal product authorised in the United Kingdom via the simplified procedure. What effect would the withdrawal of the United Kingdom have on these notifications
As of the withdrawal date the authorisation granted by the United Kingdom ceases to be valid. Therefore, in accordance with Article 17(1) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, the products notified in the other Member States can no longer be made available on the market nor used.  If you want to keep your product on the market of the notified Member States, your company will need to obtain a new authorisation of the product via the simplified procedure, from an EU-27 Member State, an EEA country or Switzerland prior to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom
and then you will have to notify the other relevant Member States, EEA countries or Switzerland.
REATED ARTICLES 22. The manufacturing site of a treated article that my EU-27-based company is placing on the EU market is located in the United Kingdom. Do we need to be concerned? Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 does not set any specific requirement regarding the location of the manufacturing site(s) of treated articles, which can be manufactured in third countries. Treated articles manufactured in third countries can be placed on the EU market if they meet the conditions of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, in particular its Articles 58 and 94. However, shipments to the EU of this treated article will be, as of the withdrawal date, importations, which may 10 have consequences from the viewpoint of other sectorial legislation (e.g. the Regulation (EU) No 649/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 concerning the export and import of hazardous chemicals, EU customs legislation, etc.). 23. What will happen to a treated article that has been manufactured outside the EU and first imported into the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date, and made available on the EU-27 market after the withdrawal date
Any treated article placed on the EU market is subject to the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, in particular Articles 58 and 94. As of the withdrawal date, shipments from the United Kingdom to the EU of this treated article will be importations. If the treated article was placed on the UK market before UK withdrawal, it can be expected to be compliant with the Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 already, and there should be no specific consequences as regards to compliance with Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 (i.e. active substance approved in the EU-27, proper labelling information etc.)
IT ISSUES
EGISTER FOR BIOCIDAL PRODUCTS (R4BP) 24. Will my UK-based company still have an access and possibility to submit a dossier via the R4BP submission tool? Yes. Companies based in third countries have access to R4PB for certain processes, e.g., active substance approval, notifications and submissions. Upon its  25. Will my UK-sible as of the withdrawal date? Yes, you will continue to have access, as non-EU companies to R4BP. UK-based companies will be able to perform the same actions allowed for non-EU companies (e.g. active substance approval submissions). 26. Will ECHA continue to grant my UK-based company access to all the information in its R4BP account after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom
UK-based companies will still have access to their data in R4BP. 27. Can a UK-based company continue to submit applications via R4BP as of the withdrawal date
A UK-that it will be able, among other things, to submit applications/notifications and monitor the progress of a given case. For instance, UK-based companies can continue to request active substance approvals (or renewals of approval) after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom. However, it is worthwhile recalling here that a biocidal product authorisation can only be granted to an EU-based company.
EUROPEAN COMMISSION DIRECTORATE-GENERAL HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY
Brussels, 23 January 2018 Rev1
NOTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES ON ANIMAL FEED The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties. In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, business operators involved in the activities falling under the scope of animal nutrition, such as applicants and authorisation holders of feed additives, applicants requesting an update of the list of feed intended for particular nutritional purposes ("PARNUTS") and feed business operators (FBOs) intending to export to the EU, are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country.  Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of animal nutrition no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has
in particular
the following consequences in the different areas of EU feed law

pplicants (natural or legal persons) for authorisation of feed additives must be established within the EU or the European Economic Area (EEA) or designate a representative established within the EU and communicate its relevant contact details to the European Commission in accordance with Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition;

Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
holders of authorisations of feed additives linked to an authorisation holder
have to designate a representative established within the EU or the EEA. The relevant contact details of the representative have to be communicated to the European Commission;  applicants for authorisations of feed additives for which the authorisation has not yet been granted by an implementing Regulation, because it is in process of evaluation or authorisation, have to designate a representative established within the EU or the EEA. The relevant contact details of the representative have to be communicated to the European Commission;  applicants for generic authorisations
of feed additives for which the authorisation has not yet been granted by an implementing Regulation because it is in process of evaluation or authorisation, have to designate a representative established within the EU or the EEA. The relevant contact details of the representative have to be communicated to the European Commission;  applicants (natural or legal persons) requesting to update the list of PARNUTs for which the authorisation is not yet granted, because it is in process of evaluation or authorisation, have to designate a representative established within the  EU or the EEA and communicate its contact details to the European Commission. In addition to applications introduced by natural or legal persons, Member States may apply to update the list of PARNUTs;   FBOs intending to export to the EU must designate a representative within the EU or the EEA for the establishments involved in that activity. In accordance with EU legislation on official controls and on feed hygiene, Member States are responsible for the authorisation of such imports from third countries. The representatives have certain obligations that should be considered by FBOs when exporting to the EU.  Applicants, holders of authorisations and FBOs will need to act sufficiently in advance to avoid any impact on the continuous supply of feed within the European Union. The necessary information will need to be submitted in due time considering the procedural timelines foreseen in the regulatory framework. The website of the Commission on animal feed (https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/animal-feed_en) provides general information on animal feed as well as a series of "Questions and answers" in relation to animal nutrition. These pages will be updated with further information, where necessary.

UESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATED TO THE UNITED KINGDOM'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH REGARD EU RULES ON ANIMAL FEED On 23 January 2018, the European Commission services published a "Notice to stakeholders
Withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules on animal feed

UTHORISATION OF FEED ADDITIVES LINKED TO AN AUTHORISATION HOLDER 3.1. I am a UK operator that applied for an authorisation for a feed additive linked to an authorisation holder but my product is not yet authorised. Do I have any obligation?  According to Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, with regard to certain additives11 no person other than the holder of the authorisation shall first place the product on the market. The name of the authorisation holder is included in the Regulation granting the authorisation of those additives.12
According to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, the applicant for an authorisation or his representative shall be established in the EU. Therefore, where the applicant for an authorisation or his representative is currently established in the United Kingdom, the applicant should establish in the EU or designate a representative established in the EU. The relevant new contact details should be communicated to the European Commission.  3.2. What are the obligations for a UK holder of an authorisation of a feed additive already authorised?
According to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, the applicant for an authorisation or his representative shall be established in the EU. Therefore, a holder established in the UK should establish in the EU or designate a representative established in the EU.

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD AND FEED AND THE DELIBERATE RELEASE OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT
The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date')2. The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'. In this regard, business operators involved in the activities falling under the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed and Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment are reminded that preparing for the withdrawal is therefore not just a matter for European and national authorities, but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, authorisation holders and applicants are reminded of certain legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country.
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of genetically modified food and feed and the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment no longer apply in the United Kingdom. This has, in particular, the following consequences in the different areas of genetically modified food and feed and the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms:
-
nder Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, authorisation holders or their representatives must be established in the European Union (or in one of the contracting states of the European Economic Area)

Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.

UNE 2009 ON THE EXPLOITATION AND MARKETING OF NATURAL MINERAL WATERS The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement
food business operators in the field of the exploitation and marketing of natural mineral waters are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of the exploitation and marketing of natural mineral waters apply to the United Kingdom as third country. This has
in particular
the following consequences in the different areas of the natural mineral water legislation
According to Article 1(1) and (2) and Article 2 of Directive 2009/54/EC, waters may only be marketed as natural mineral waters in the European Union if they comply with the following:
where waters are extracted from the ground of a Member State, the responsible authority of that Member State has recognised the waters as natural mineral waters in accordance with Directive 2009/54/EC
Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
2
where waters are extracted from the ground of a third country, the responsible authority of a Member State has recognised the waters as natural mineral waters in accordance with Directive 2009/54/EC. It follows that, from the withdrawal date:
Waters currently extracted from the ground of, and recognised by the United Kingdom as natural mineral waters shall be considered as extracted from the ground of a third country and should no longer be authorised for import into the European Union, unless they are recognised as such by the responsible authority of another Member State
- Waters currently extracted from the ground of a third country and recognised as natural mineral waters by the responsible authority of the United Kingdom should no longer be authorised for import into the European Union, unless they are recognised as such by the responsible authority of another Member State

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF MARKETING OF SEEDS AND OTHER PLANT REPRODUCTIVE PROPAGATING MATERIAL The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement
all breeders and suppliers of seeds and other plant reproductive material covered by Directives 66/401/EEC (fodder plants), 66/402/EEC (cereals), 68/193/EEC (vine), 98/56/EC (ornamentals), 1999/105/EC (forest reproductive material), 2002/53/EC (Common Catalogue of agricultural varieties), 2002/54/EC (beet), 2002/55/EC (vegetable seeds), 2002/56/EC (potato seeds), 2002/57/EC (oil and fibre plants), 2008/72/EC (vegetable propagating material) and 2008/90/EC (fruit plants) are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of marketing of plant reproductive material no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has
in particular
the following consequences in the fields of inclusion in Common Catalogues and marketing
Inclusion in Common Catalogues or national registry (catalogue, register or list) All breeders and suppliers concerned by the marketing of the seed and propagating material mentioned above are reminded of certain legal repercussions, which need to be considered for the possible actions:
Varieties of agricultural and vegetable species have to be maintained in an EU-27-Member State in order for their seed to be allowed to be marketed within the Union.
Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
2
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
3
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
According to the above mentioned legislation, varieties of fodder plant seed, cereal seed, beet seed, vegetable seed, vegetable propagating material, seed potatoes and seed of oil and fibre plants (agricultural and vegetable species) must be examined and accepted by at least one Member State and listed in the Common Catalogues of Directive 2002/53/EC or Directive 2002/55/EC to be allowed to be marketed throughout the Union. Varieties that have been included in the Common Catalogues by the United Kingdom only must be accepted by another Member State in order for the varieties to remain in those Common Catalogues in order to continue to be allowed to be marketed in the EU after the withdrawal date. The interested parties should thus submit the respective applications to the responsible official body of an EU-27-Member State in a timely manner before that date, in order to ensure that those varieties are also inserted in a timely manner in the respective Common Catalogues.  Pursuant to Directive 68/193/EEC on vine propagating material, Directive 1999/105/EC on forest reproductive material, Directive 2008/90/EC on fruit propagating material, varieties or forest basic material may only be marketed throughout the Union once they are included in the national registry in one Member State or
in the case of Directive 1998/56/EC on ornamental propagating material  at least in a suppliers list of an EU-27 Member State. Varieties or basic material of forest plants included in the registry of United Kingdom only must be accepted by another Member State or supplier in another Member States in order for those varieties or material to continue to be allowed to be marketed in the EU after the withdrawal date. The interested parties should thus submit the respective applications to the responsible official body or supplier of an EU27-Member State in a timely manner before that date, in order to ensure that those varieties or material are inserted in a timely manner in the national registry or suppliers list.  Several varieties intended for inclusion in the Common Catalogue of Directives 2002/53/EC or 2002/55/EC are currently being tested in premises of the United Kingdom (at the request of either breeders or of examination offices of EU-27 Member States on the basis of bilateral testing arrangements). Breeders should be aware that after the withdrawal date
the examination results have to stem from examinations in an E
27 Member State for the variety to be included in the Common Catalogues or national registry. Breeders should also bear in mind that, in addition to examinations for DUS (Distinctness, Uniformity and Stability) where all Member States apply the same requirements, certain varieties will also need additional examinations for VCU (Value for Cultivation and Use) where the requirements of certain Member States might be different from the requirements of the United Kingdom. Marketing of seed and propagating material According to the aforementioned legislation, imports of seed and propagating material from third countries are subject to the respective provisions of each Directive concerning recognition of equivalent requirements of third countries.
Finally, stakeholders should be aware that preparing for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom is not just a matter for European and national administrations, but also for private parties. Breeders may thus be required to monitor the developments, adapt processes and to consider the changes described above.

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES ON PLANT HEALTH  The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, operators involved in production and trade of plants, plant products and other objects addressed in the EU plant health legislation ("other objects") are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU plant health legislation in the field of intra-Union trade in plants, plant products and other objects no longer apply to the United Kingdom.
The legal consequences presented below stem from EU plant health legislation with regard to plants
plant products or other objects placed on the EU-27 market
as from the withdrawal date and coming from a third country (i.e. imported).

Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.

all breeders within the meaning of Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2100/94 on Community plant variety rights (hereinafter: the Basic Regulation) are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of Plant Variety Rights no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has
in particular
the following consequences
All Community Plant Variety Rights granted pursuant to the Basic Regulation will remain valid in the Union territory, regardless of the origin of the breeder or the location of the Examination Offices.  The Examination Offices in the United Kingdom will no longer have the possibility to participate in the technical verification of the maintenance of the protected varieties pursuant to Articles 64 and 65 of the Basic Regulation.

2 verifications following 30 March 2019 will be organised by the CPVO in an EU-27 based Examination Office.  According to Article 82 of the Basic Regulation, persons who are not domiciled or do not have a seat or an establishment within the EU territory may participate as party to proceedings before the Office only if they have designated a procedural representative who is domiciled or has his seat or an establishment within the EU territory. All interested breeders who are currently domiciled or have a seat in the United Kingdom only should consider the need to designate in a timely manner a procedural representative to comply with the provisions of that Article. Actions to be taken by the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) The Examination Offices in the United Kingdom are entrusted for 864 botanical taxa. Out of those
there are 678 botanical taxa for which no other Examination Office is entrusted in the Union. The CPVO has received applications regarding 324 of the aforesaid 678 botanical taxa. In order to ensure the continuity of the technical examination of varieties belonging to those botanical taxa, the CPVO has organised a procedure (the "new species procedure") to ensure as from 30 March 2019 at the latest the entrustment of Examination Offices in the Union to cover at least all 324 botanical taxa for which an actual application for a Community Plant Variety Right has been received by the CPVO. The procedure has progressed satisfactorily and six Examination Offices have been entrusted in the Union for 322 of the above species. However, taking into account the need for some Examination Offices to adapt to the new technical expectations, DUS tests for some species can only start in October 2018 or January 2019
All information on entrusted Examination Offices and species are available on the CP
web site
In order to avoid as much as possible transitional difficulties, CPVO will stop assigning the technical examination of varieties (Article 55(1) of the Basic Regulation) to the Examination Offices in the United Kingdom, where that examination is expected to last beyond 29 March 2019.

UPPLY OF INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS According to Article 13(1) of Directive 2001/20/EC, the import of investigational medicinal products into the EU is subject to the holding of an authorisation. This authorisation is also required if only part of the manufacturing (e.g. packaging or repacking, for example as part of blinding activities) is performed in the third country. Article 13(2) of Directive 2001/20/EC requires the holder of this authorisation to have permanently and continuously at his disposal the services of at least one qualified person located in the EU. The qualified person is responsible for ensuring that each production batch of an investigational medicinal product intended to be used in a clinical trial has been manufactured and checked in accordance with the standards of good manufacturing practices at least equivalent to those laid down in the EU and that each production batch has been checked in accordance the clinical trial authorisation (Article 13(3)(b) of Directive 2001/20/EC). Regarding comparator investigational medicinal product
which are authorised in a third country, the qualified person is responsible for ensuring, subject to exceptions, that each production batch has undergone all relevant analyses, tests or checks necessary to confirm its quality (Article 13(3)(c) of Directive 2001/20/EC).

OTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU FOOD LAW AND EU RULES ON QUALITY SCHEMES
The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that as from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET)
the United Kingdom will be a third country
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the uncertainties
urrounding the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, all interested parties, and especially economic operators, are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to the transition period provided for in the draft Withdrawal Agreement,
as of the withdrawal date, EU food law
and EU rules on quality schemes no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences:

Including protected designations of origin (PDO), protected geographical indications (PGI), geographical indication of spirit drinks and aromatised wines (GI) and traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG).

n accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.

EU RULES ON QUALITY SCHEMES  EU quality schemes protect the names of specific products to promote their unique characteristics, linked to their geographical origin as well as traditional know-how. Product names can be granted with a 'geographical indication' (GI) if they have a specific link to the place where they are made. The applicable rules are in particular contained in the following pieces of EU legislation:  Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs71
in respect of Protected designations of origin, Protected geographical indications and Traditional specialities guaranteed);  Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the                                                                                                                                                  laying down detailed rules for implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 as regards the arrangements for imports of organic products from third countries,  OJ L 334, 12.12.2008, p. 25). 69
See Article 2(j) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 and the definition in Article 3(8) of Regulation (EC) including offering for sale or any other form of transfer, whether free of charge or not, and the sale, distribution, and other forms of transfer themselves 70
This is currently only the case for one UK-based body, see Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008
71
OJ L 343, 14.12.2012, p. 1.

in respect of Geographical indications).  As from the withdrawal date, EU legislation protecting the registered Protected designations of origin, Protected geographical indications, Geographical indications and Traditional specialities guaranteed will no longer have effect in the United Kingdom. Any right granted in accordance with the aforementioned Union law to protect Protected designations of origin, Protected geographical indications, Geographical indications and Traditional specialities guaranteed on or after the withdrawal date will only apply in the EU-27 Member States.  designations of origin, Protected geographical indications, Geographical indications and Traditional specialities guaranteed registered and protected in accordance with the aforementioned Union law might not be protected in the United Kingdom without interruption. As such, interested right holders should assess whether to seek alternative means of securing protection of the relevant geographical names in the United Kingdom, in accordance with United Kingdom law.

Brussels, 30 January 2018
NOTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF CUSTOMS AND INDIRECT TAXATION
The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.
n view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, economic operators are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of customs (see below, 1)
Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
For a movement of goods that has started before and ends on or after the withdrawal date, the EU undertakes to agree solutions with the United Kingdom in the withdrawal agreement on the basis of the EU's position on Customs related matters needed for an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union ( https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/position-paper-customs-related-matters-needed-orderly-withdrawal-uk-union_en
. Th
position paper also addresses administrative cooperation procedures on or after the withdrawal date between the EU-27 and the United Kingdom related to facts that have occurred prior to the withdrawal date (for example, mutual assistance related to the verification of proofs of origin).
2 and indirect taxation (VAT and excise duties  see below, 2
no longer apply to the United Kingdom.
This has in particular the following consequences as of the withdrawal date
1.
USTOMS
oods which are brought into the customs territory of the EU from the United Kingdom or are to be taken out of that territory for transport to the United Kingdom, are subject to customs supervision and may be subject to customs controls in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code
This implies inter alia that customs formalities apply
declarations have to be lodged and customs authorities may require guarantees for potential or existing customs debts

oods which are brought into the customs territory of the EU from the United Kingdom are subject to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff
This implies the application of the relevant customs duties.  Certain goods which enter the EU from the United Kingdom or are leaving the EU to the United Kingdom are subject to prohibitions or restrictions on grounds of public policy or public security, the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants, or the protection of national treasures.

uthorisations granting the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) and other authorisations for customs simplifications
issued by the customs authorities of the United Kingdom will no longer be valid in the customs territory of the Union.   Goods originating in the United Kingdom that are incorporated in goods exported from the EU to third countries will no longer qualify as "EU content" for the purpose of the EU's Common Commercial Policy. This affects the ability of EU exporters to cumulate with goods originating in the United Kingdom and may affect the applicability of preferential tariffs agreed by the Union with third countries.
This note does not address the general customs and tax free allowances applicable to goods in the personal luggage of travelers entering the EU.
The listing illustrates some important consequences in the field of customs and indirect taxation of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union but is not meant to be exhaustive.

2.
NDIRECT TAXATION (VAT AND EXCISE DUTIES

oods which enter the VAT territory of the E
from the United Kingdom or are dispatched or transported from the VAT territory of the E
to the United Kingdom will respectively be treated as importation or exportation of goods in accordance with Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (the 'VAT Directive').10 This implies charging VAT at importation, while exports are exempt from VAT
Taxable persons wishing to use one of the special schemes of Chapter 6 of Title XII of the VAT Directive (the so-called Mini One-Stop Shop or MOSS)
who supply telecommunications services, broadcasting services or electronic services to non-taxable persons in the EU
will have to
registered for the MOSS in a Member State of the EU.
axable persons established in the United Kingdom purchasing goods and services or importing goods subject to VAT in a Member State of the EU who wish to claim a refund of that VAT may no longer file electronically in accordance with Council Directive 2008/9/EC11 but have to claim in accordance with Council Directive 86/560/EEC12. Member States may make refunds under the latter Directive subject to reciprocity.  A company established in the United Kingdom carrying out taxable transactions in a Member State of the EU may be required by that Member State to designate a tax representative as the person liable for payment of the VAT in accordance with the VAT Directive
The movement of goods which enter the excise territory of the E
from the United Kingdom or are dispatched or transported from the excise territory of the EU to the United Kingdom will respectively be treated as importation or exportation of excise goods in accordance with Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty13
This implies, inter alia, that the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) on its own will no longer be applicable to excise duty suspended movements of excise goods from the EU into the United Kingdom, but those movements will be treated as exports, where excise supervision ends at the place of exit from the EU. Movements of excise goods to the United Kingdom will therefore require an export declaration as well as an electronic administrative document (e-AD). Movements of excise goods from the United Kingdom to the EU will have to be released from customs formalities before a movement under EMCS can begin.                                                  10

OTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF IMPORT/EXPORT LICENCES FOR CERTAIN GOODS The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties
In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, stakeholders engaged in shipments of goods which are subject to import/export licences or which may become subject to import/export licences as of the withdrawal date are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom itself becomes a third country

Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, for shipments of goods to/from third countries, including the United Kingdom, the following applies with regard to import/export licences

Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU

This notice does not address rules based on the EURATOM Treaty.
1.
MPORT/EXPORT LICENCES REQUIRED UNDER UNION LAW Different areas of Union law provide, for certain goods, a mandatory authorisation/approval/notification of shipments from a third country to the European Union or vice versa (hereafter "import/export licences"). In most cases, such licence is not required for intra-Union shipments, or the requirements differ. Usually, import/export licences are issued by national competent authorities, and compliance is controlled as part of customs controls in the European Union
As of the withdrawal date, where the import/export of goods is subject to a licensing requirement under Union law, shipments from the EU-27 to the United Kingdom and vice versa will require such an import/export licence.
2.
MPORT/EXPORT LICENCES ISSUED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM AS AN EU
EMBER STATE ON THE BASIS OF
NION LAW Union law may provide for the possibility of import/export licences to be issued by a Member State other than the Member State where the good enters or exits the European Union.  As of the withdrawal date, import/export licences issued by the United Kingdom as an EU Member State on the basis of Union law are no long valid for shipments to the EU-27 from third countries or vice versa
3.
OODS CONCERNED Import/export licences exist in a wide range of policy areas and for a wide variety of goods, including the following:  Waste
(Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on shipments of waste7);

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that, unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties. In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, intellectual property right owners are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Subject to any transitional arrangements that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules on customs enforcement of intellectual property rights, and in particular Regulation (EU) No 608/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 2013 concerning customs enforcement of intellectual property rights,
no longer appl

According to Section 1 of Chapter II of Regulation (EU) No 608/2013, an applicant can submit to the competent customs department a Union application requesting the customs authorities of that Member State and of one or more other Member States to take action with respect to goods suspected of infringing an intellectual property right
In the case of
Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reach a withdrawal agreement.

Submission of Union applications: As of the withdrawal date, Union applications can no longer be submitted to the competent customs department of the United Kingdom. Union applications submitted in one of the EU-27 Member States remain valid in the EU-27 as of the withdrawal date even if the customs authorities of the United Kingdom are amongst the customs authorities requested to take action.

CUSTOMS AND EXTERNAL TRADE
PREFERENTIAL ORIGIN OF GOODS The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that, unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for economic operators
Economic operators are reminded
of the legal repercussions concerning rules of origin for preferential treatment of goods
which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country.
In particular, as of the withdrawal date, the EU preferential trade arrangements with third countries in the field of the common commercial policy and customs no longer apply to the United Kingdom

Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
This notice complements the information on rules of origin in the "Notice to stakeholders  withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in the field of customs and indirect taxation" of 30 January 2018 (https://ec.europa.eu/info/brexit/brexit-preparedness_en).
For certain movement
of goods that have started before and end on or after the withdrawal date, the EU aims at agreeing solutions with the United Kingdom in the withdrawal agreement on the basis of the EU's position on Customs related matters needed for an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/position-paper-customs-related-matters-needed-orderly-withdrawal-uk-union_en). The position paper also addresses administrative cooperation procedures on or after the withdrawal date between the EU-27 and the United Kingdom related to facts that have occurred prior to the withdrawal date (for example, mutual assistance related to the verification of proofs of origin). These arrangements will, however, only apply if a withdrawal agreement is signed and ratified by the EU and the UK before the withdrawal date.
2 1.
ACKGROUND ON PREFERENTIAL ORIGIN As part of the EU common commercial policy, the EU has preferential trade arrangements with third countries, such as Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and the Generalised Scheme of Preferences
(GSP).
Goods exported from the EU may benefit from preferential tariff treatment in an EU FTA partner country when they have EU preferential origin, i.e. they are either from materials which are subject to working or processing fulfilling certain
oods imported into the EU from third countries with which the EU has preferential trade arrangements receive preferential tariff treatment if they comply with preferential rules of origin
For the purpose of determining the preferential origin of goods manufactured in a third countr
with which the EU has a preferential trade arrangement, EU originating inputs (materials and, in some arrangements, processing operations) incorporated in those goods are deemed to be originating in that third country (cumulation of origin). The rules and procedures for the determination of a preferential origin are contained in the respective preferential trade arrangements and may vary depending on these arrangements
For
h
determination of preferential origin, the EU is considered as a single territory, no distinction being made between Member State
Therefore, United Kingdom inputs (materials or processing operations) currently account as EU  for the determination of the EU preferential origin of goods
The origin of the goods is certified commercial documents. The origin of goods may be subject to verification by the exporting party, upon request from the importing party. To provide evidence of compliance with origin requirements, the exporter obtains
In case an agreement is reached on transitional arrangements in a possible withdrawal agreement, the Union will notify the other parties to the international agreements (including agreements that provide for preferential tariff treatment) concluded by the Union, or by Member States on its behalf or by the Union and its Member States acting jointly that
during the transition period, the United Kingdom is to be treated as a Member State for the purposes of these agreements.
http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/development/generalised-scheme-of-preferences/index_en.htm

With regard to the issues set out in this notice (effect of United Kingdom input when determining the preferential origin for tariff treatment)
the preferential tariff treatments in the Generalised Scheme of Preferences may be in practice less relevant than Free Trade Agreements. However, for the sake of completeness, both aspects are addressed in this notice.
A list of all EU preferential arrangements with third countries is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/calculation-customs-duties/rules-origin/general-aspects-preferential-origin/arrangements-list_en

ONSEQUENCES OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM As of the withdrawal date
the United Kingdom becomes a third country to which the EU preferential trade arrangements with third countries cease to apply. United Kingdom inputs (materials or processing operations) are considered a- for the determination of the preferential origin of goods incorporating those inputs. This means the following:  Goods exported from the EU
As of the withdrawal date, a
EU FTA partner country may consider that goods having an EU preferential origin before the withdrawal date no longer qualif
at the moment of their importation in that third country
due to United Kingdom inputs
As of the withdrawal date, in case of verification of the origin of goods exported to a third country under preferential treatment, the exporters in the EU-27 may, upon request from that third country, have to prove the EU origin of the goods taking into account that United Kingdom input  Goods imported into the EU
United Kingdom inputs incorporated in goods obtained in third countries with which the EU has preferential trade arrangements and imported into the EU as of the withdrawal date will be

WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES  IN THE FIELD OF
ALUE ADDED TAX The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. On 22 March 2019, the European Council (Article 50) decided, in agreement with the United Kingdom, and in the event that the Withdrawal Agreement is approved by the House of Commons by 29 March, to extend the 2-years period provided for in Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union until 22 May 2019.  In the event that the Withdrawal Agreement is not approved by the House of Commons by 29 March 2019, the European Council decided to extend the period provided for in Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union until 12 April 2019. This means that as from 13 April 2019, 00:00h
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the uncertainties surrounding the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, all interested parties, and especially economic operators, are reminded of legal repercussions in the field of value added tax (VAT), which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Subject to the transition period provided for in the draft Withdrawal Agreement,
as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of VAT, and in particular Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax
(hereafter the 'VAT Directive') and Council Directive 2008/9/EC of 12 February 2008 laying down detailed rules for the refund of value added tax, provided for in Directive

1. VAT PAYMENTS AND LIABILITY 1.1. Treatment of supplies of goods between the EU and the United Kingdom 1.1.1. EU rules for VAT payments/returns for cross-border supplies of goods EU VAT legislation provides for different regimes of VAT payments/returns for cross-border supplies/acquisitions and movements to/from Member States and third countries.  As of the withdrawal date, the EU rules for cross-border supplies and movements between EU Member States will no longer apply in the relations between EU-27 Member States and the United Kingdom (e.g. no intra-Community supplies and acquisitions
no distance sales regime for goods to and from the United Kingdom).
Instead, as of the withdrawal date, supplies and movements of goods between the EU and the United Kingdom are subject to the VAT rules on imports and exports. This implies that goods which are brought into the VAT territory of the EU from the United Kingdom or are to be taken out of that territory for transport to the United Kingdom, will be subject to customs supervision and may be subject to customs controls in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code.
VAT will be due at the importation in the EU7, at the rate that applies to the supplies of the same goods within the EU.
VAT will be payabl
to customs authorities at the time of importation, unless the Member State of importation allows to enter import VAT in the periodical VAT return of the taxable person

First the exporter will present the goods and a pre-departure declaration (customs declaration, re-export declaration, exit summary declaration) at the customs office responsible for the place where he is established or where the goods are packed or loaded for export shipment (customs office of export). Subsequently, the goods will be presented at the customs office of exit which may examine the goods presented based on the information received from the customs office of export and will supervise their physical exit out of the EU customs territory.  Goods will be exempt from VAT if they are dispatched or transported to a destination outside the EU.11 The supplier of exported goods must be able to prove that the goods have left the EU. In this regard, Member States generally base themselves on the certification of exit given to the exporter by the customs office of export

Re-importation of goods after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom Article 143(1)(e) of the VAT Directive provides for an exemption from VAT of the reimportation, by the person who exported them, of goods in the state in which they were exported, where those goods are exempt from customs duties.  There may be situations where goods that were transported or dispatched from an EU-27 Member State to the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date, are returned

situations of importation where goods that have not been exported but were transported or dispatched from one of the EU-27 Member States to the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date are returned from the United Kingdom as from the withdrawal date.13 In these cases as there will be no export declaration available, the person who is reimporting the goods shall use alternative means to prove that the goods are re-imported in unaltered state within the time limit referred to in Article 203(1) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 laying down the Union Customs Code.14 Taxable persons in the EU should take all necessary steps to ensure that they can provide all necessary evidence with regard to their intra-Community supplies and intra-Community acquisitions to/from the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date, and with regard to all other supplies that they have made in, or received from, the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date. Taxable persons may have to familiarize themselves with customs procedures and formalities regarding import and export of goods.15                                                  12

5 1.1.4. Personal property imported after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom Article 4 of Directive 2009/132/EC provides for an exemption from VAT of personal property imported by natural persons when moving their place of residence from outside the EU to the EU. The exemption is subject to the possession of the personal property and, in the case of non-consumable goods, its use by the person concerned at his or her former normal place of residence for a minimum of six months before the date on which he or she ceases to have his or her normal place of residence outside the Union.  There may be situations where natural persons move their residence from the United Kingdom to the EU-27 on or after the withdrawal date. For natural persons moving their normal place of residence from the United Kingdom to an EU-27 Member State within 6 months as from the withdrawal date, the exemption laid down in Article 4 of Directive 2009/132/EC shall apply to personal property imported by such persons into the EU-27 as from the withdrawal date. 16 However, the exemption shall be subject to the following conditions: a. the goods concerned have been in the possession of and, in the case of non-consumable goods, used by the person concerned at his or her former normal place of residence in the United Kingdom for a minimum of six months (except in special cases justified by circumstances) before the date on which he or she ceased to have his or her normal place of residence outside the EU-27; and b. such property ha
borne the customs and/or fiscal charges to which it was normally liable in the United Kingdom or in one of the EU-27 Member States before the importation in the EU. 1.2. Treatment of supplies of services between the EU and the United Kingdom 1.2.1. EU rules on VAT for cross-border supplies of services EU VAT legislation provides for different regimes of VAT payments/returns for cross-border supplies of services to/from Member States and third countries.  The place of supply of services depends on various factors, such as the nature of the service, whether or not the person receiving the service is a taxable person, the place where the service is carried out, etc.                                                   16

The withdrawal of the United Kingdom may have an impact for taxable persons established in the United Kingdom who supply services in the EU from the withdrawal date and for taxable persons established in the EU who supply services in the United Kingdom from the withdrawal date
In particular
Member States are permitted to require the designation of a tax representative if the taxable person supplying the services is established in a third country that does not provide administrative cooperation and recovery assistance for VAT.17 As of the withdrawal date, this requirement may apply to taxable persons established in the United Kingdom. Taxable persons established in the United Kingdom applying the Mini One-Stop Shop (MOSS) scheme for their Business-to-Consumer supplies of telecom, broadcasting and electronic services to customers in the EU will have to change their MOSS identification (see point 1.3. below). 1.2.2. Advice to taxable persons for preparing for a withdrawal without withdrawal agreemen
Taxable persons established in the EU should take all necessary steps to ensure that they can provide all necessary evidence with regard to the supplies of services before the withdrawal date that they have made in, or received from, the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date. Taxable persons established in the United Kingdom will have to examine whether new liability rules will apply to them with regard to their supplies of services that take place within the EU after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom.  1.3. Submission of VAT returns through the Mini One-Stop Shop scheme 1.3.1. The EU Mini One-Stop Shop scheme In accordance with Article 58 of the VAT Directive, VAT on Business-to-Consumer supplies of telecom, broadcasting and electronic services are subject to VAT in the Member State of consumption.  Articles 358 to 369k of the VAT Directive set the legal framework for special schemes for non-established taxable persons supplying telecommunications services, broadcasting or electronic services to non-taxable persons in the EU  the Mini One-Stop Shop (MOSS) schemes. MOSS allows a taxable person to submit a MOSS VAT return for each calendar quarter to the Member State of identification. That Member State of identification splits the MOSS VAT return by                                                  17
Article 204 of the VAT Directive.
7 Member State of consumption and forwards the details to the various Member States of consumption.  The VAT Directive provides for a MOSS scheme for taxable persons established in a Member State different from the Member State of consumption ("Union MOSS scheme"), and for a MOSS scheme for taxable persons established in a third country ("non-Union MOSS scheme"). 1.3.2. Advice to taxable persons for preparing for a withdrawal without withdrawal agreement a) Taxable persons established in an EU-27 Member State or in a third country, identified for MOSS in the EU-27 and making Business-to-Consumer supplies of telecom, broadcasting and electronic services to customers in the United Kingdom:  These taxable persons are liable to pay the VAT for services provided until and including the day before the withdrawal date (i.e. until and including 29 March 2019) in accordance with the VAT Directive. For the services provided in the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom must still be considered a Member State of consumption. Thus, MOSS VAT returns for the first calendar quarter of 2019 should also cover services provided in the United Kingdom up to the withdrawal date, even though taxable persons are to submit those MOSS VAT returns after the withdrawal date.
b) Taxable persons identified for MOSS in the United Kingdom and making Business-to-Consumer supplies of telecom, broadcasting and electronic services to customers in the EU-27 Member States:
These taxable persons are liable to pay the VAT for services in accordance with the VAT Directive. In the absence of a withdrawal agreement, in order to facilitate the submission of returns to the EU-27 Member States for the services supplied from 1 January 2019 until and including the day before the withdrawal date (i.e. until and including 29 March 2019), these taxable persons should take the following measures:
Taxable persons established in a third country and identified for MOSS in the non-Union MOSS scheme in the United Kingdom: These taxable persons should move their MOSS-identification from the United Kingdom to an EU-27 Member State. An early move  even before the first quarter of 2019  may facilitate future corrections of MOSS returns submitted before the withdrawal date.18                                                  18
Within the EU, corrective returns can be submitted until 3 years following the tax period concerned (Article 61(2) of Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2011).
8
Taxable persons established in a third country with a fixed establishment in the United Kingdom and in at least one EU-27 Member State: If these taxable persons have opted for identification for the Union MOSS scheme in the United Kingdom and maintain their fixed establishment in the United Kingdom, these taxable persons are in principle bound by their decision for the calendar year concerned and the two calendar years following (in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 369a of the VAT Directive). However, as they cannot remain identified for the Union MOSS scheme in the United Kingdom as from the withdrawal date, they should move their identification for the Union MOSS scheme from the United Kingdom to a Member State of the EU-27 with effect from the withdrawal date.19
Taxable persons established only in the United Kingdom: If these taxable persons have opted for identification for the Union MOSS scheme and maintain their fixed establishment in the United Kingdom, and want to continue to use the MOSS scheme, they should register for the non-Union MOSS scheme in a Member State of the EU-27 with effect from the withdrawal date, in accordance with Article 359 of the VAT Directive, since they will be considered as taxable persons not established within the EU as of the withdrawal date
If, in accordance with the advice given in section 1.3.2., taxable persons currently identified for MOSS in the United Kingdom become identified for MOSS in one of the EU-27 Member States, they could report their MOSS transactions of the first quarter of 2019 to customers in the EU-27 in the first MOSS VAT return which they submit in an EU-27 Member State in April 2019, in accordance with Article 369f of the VAT Directive.  2. VAT REFUND
2.1. EU rules for VAT refunds EU VAT legislation provides for different regimes of VAT refunds to taxable persons not established in the Member State in which they have paid VAT. This depends on whether the taxable person is established in the EU or in a third country. a) Taxable persons established in the EU:                                                   19
Article 369a, second paragraph, of the VAT Directive provides that these taxable persons are bound by their decision for the calendar year concerned and the two calendar years following. This implies that if their decision to identify for the Union MOSS scheme in the United Kingdom was taken before 2017, these taxable persons could already move their identification for the Union MOSS scheme to a
EU-27 Member State with effect before the withdrawal date.
9 According to Articles 170 and 171 of the VAT Directive, taxable persons established in a Member State can request a Member State where they are not established to refund the VAT paid there. The following procedure applies:
he refund request must be submitted electronically to the Member State of establishment at the latest on 30 September of the year following the refund period (Article 15 of Directive 2008/9/EC);

he refund request must be forwarded by the Member State of establishment to the Member State of refund within 15 days (Article 48(1) of Council Regulation (EU) No 904/201020);

he Member State of refund must take a decision on the refund request within 4 months (Article 19(2) of Directive 2008/9/EC); if the refund application is approved, the refund must be paid within 4 months + 10 working days (Article 22 of Directive 2008/9/EC); these periods can be prolonged if the Member State of refund asks additional information (Article 21 of Directive 2008/9/EC). b) Taxable persons established outside the EU:  According to the Thirteenth Council Directive 86/560/EEC of 17 November 1986 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes
Arrangements for the refund of value added tax to taxable persons not established in Community territory21
hereafter '13th VAT Directive'), VAT refunds by Member States to taxable persons established outside the EU are subject to the following conditions

he request must be submitted directly to the Member State from which the refund is requested, in accordance with the arrangements determined by that Member State (Article 3(1) of the 13th VAT Directive)

he VAT refund may be subject to a reciprocity condition (meaning that the refund is only permitted if VAT refund is also granted by the third country to taxable persons established in the Member State concerned (Article 2(2) of the 13th VAT Directive);

ach Member State may require the taxable person established in a third country to designate a tax representative in order to obtain the VAT refund (Article 2(3) of the 13th VAT Directive).                                                  20

10 2.2. Pending situations: refund of VAT charged before the withdrawal date in an EU-27 Member State to taxable persons established in the United Kingdom and not yet reimbursed
2.2.1. Submission of applications Those taxable persons who have not submitted a refund application before the withdrawal date, or in respect of which the refund application has not yet been forwarded by their State of establishment to the State of refund by that date, must submit or resubmit their refund application directly to the State of refund. For applications for refund from an EU-27 Member State, this submission shall be done according to the procedure of the 13th VAT Directive.22
2.2.2. Substantial rules Although, as from the withdrawal date, Directive 2008/9/EC ceases to apply to the United Kingdom, the rights and corresponding obligations of taxable persons derived from that Directive continue to apply with regard to VAT charged in an EU-27 Member State to a taxable person before the withdrawal date
23
This will encompass notably the right to a refund of VAT, the time limits to submit a refund application, the information to be provided, the time limits to be notified or to be requested to provide additional information, the time limits to provide the requested additional or further additional information, the time limits to be refunded and the right to receive interest in case of late payment. Further, for the purposes of Articles 16 and 17 of Directive 2008/9/EC, the refund applications relating to VAT charged from 1 January 2019 until and including the day before the withdrawal date shall be treated as relating to the remainder of a calendar year. The provisions on reciprocity (Article 2(2) of the 13th VAT Directive), on the appointment of a tax representative (Article 2(3) of the 13th VAT Directive) and on the exclusion of certain expenditure or possible additional conditions (Article 4(2) of the 13th VAT Directive) shall not be applicable in respect of VAT charged before the withdrawal date. However, in accordance with Article 273 of the VAT Directive, Member States may require the applicant to provide evidence of his status as taxable person or the original or copy of the invoices.                                                  22
As from the withdrawal date, a taxable person established in one of the EU-27 Member States or in the United Kingdom can no longer use the electronic portal set up by his State of establishment for submitting an electronic refund application in accordance with Article 7 of Directive 2008/9/EC. 23
See the guidelines of the VAT Committee of 13 March 2019 (https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/guidelines-of-the-vat-committee-in-case-of-no-deal_en.pdf).
11 2.2.3. Additional request
for information As from the withdrawal date the exchange of information between tax authorities relating to VAT refund applications provided for in Article 48(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) No 904/2010 no longer applies in relation to the United Kingdom. Any request for information by the EU-27 Member State of refund with regard to a VAT refund application will therefore have to be addressed directly to the taxable person concerned.
2.3. Advice to taxable persons for preparing for a withdrawal without withdrawal agreement a) Taxable persons established in the EU-27 and requesting refunds from the United Kingdom: These taxable persons are entitled to a refund from the United Kingdom for the period until and including the day before the withdrawal date (i.e. until and including 29 March 2019). There is currently no certainty about the future UK-regime for VAT refunds to taxable persons established outside the United Kingdom. Therefore, taxable persons established in the EU-27 should consider requesting refunds from the United Kingdom while the United Kingdom is still a Member State, provided that the conditions set out in the VAT Directive and Directive 2008/9/EC are fulfilled.
b) Taxable persons established in the United Kingdom and requesting refunds from a
EU-27 Member State
As of the withdrawal date, requests by these taxable persons for a refund from the EU-27 Member States follow the procedural EU rules for taxable persons established outside the EU (see above).
The website of the Commission on taxation and customs union (https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/index_en) provide

UIDANCE NOTE
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND CUSTOMS RELATED MATTERS  IN CASE OF NO DEAL The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means
the United Kingdom will
This guidance note addresses a situation where the UK becomes a third country on the withdrawal date without a withdrawal agreement and hence without a transition period provided for in the draft Withdrawal Agreement.
As of the withdrawal date, the Union rules in the field of customs no longer apply to the UK. The UK will be treated as any other third country with which the EU does not have any preferential trade relationship or customs or other agreements or arrangements
Preferences shall not be granted either to goods originating in the Overseas Countries and Territories which have special relations with the UK and are listed in Annex II of the TFEU (UK OCTs).
As of that date, appropriate rules in the field of customs, including the common customs tariff, and EU commercial policy measures will apply to the UK.  Furthermore, the UK will no longer have access to the EU customs IT systems.
In accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.

CONOMIC OPERATOR REGISTRATION IDENTIFICATION (EORI
a) Following the withdrawal of the UK the trade patterns of persons, established in the Union, who currently carr
out transaction
only with economic operators or other persons in the UK might change. While they are currently not involved in trade with third countries but only in intra-Union transactions, and hence have not been assigned an EORI number by any MS, they will carry out transactions requiring customs formalities. This requires, according to UCC
legislation, them to register with customs authorities in the Member State where they are established
Nothing prevents those economic operators to submit the required data or undertake the necessary steps for the registration (Annex 12-01 UCC DA8) already in advance of the withdrawal date
b) Two categories of persons currently established in the UK or registered with a UK EORI number need to be distinguished
Persons who are currently not involved in trade with third countries but only in intra-Union transactions
and who hence have not been assigned an EORI number by any MS, but as of the withdrawal date intend to carry out transactions requiring customs formalities, which, according to UCC legislation, requires them to be registered with customs authorities in the Union.   Economic operators and other persons, including third country operators, who have a currently valid EORI number assigned by the UK customs authority which will be invalid in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date
In this case, economic operators must be aware of the fact that they have to register with the competent customs authorit
in the EU27 and to use the new EORI number when applying for a customs decision after the withdrawal. Following the withdrawal, economic operators established in the UK or in another third country, have to register according to Article 9(2) UCC with the competent customs authority in a Member State. Economic operators that have a permanent business establishment in a Member State as defined in Article 5(32) UCC have to register with the customs authorities in the Member State where the permanent

business establishment is situated. Economic operators that do not have a permanent business establishment in a Member State have to register in the Member State responsible for the place where they first lodge a declaration or apply for a decision; in addition, those economic operators need to appoint a fiscal representative, where required by current legislation
Nothing prevents also those economic operators to submit the required data or undertake the necessary steps for the registration (Annex 12-01 UCC DA) already in advance of the withdrawal date. Customs authorities of the Member States should accept requests already before the withdrawal date and assign to them EORI numbers with the withdrawal date as the starting date "YYYYMMDD
or thereafter, according to the requests of the persons concerned. 2.
USTOMS DECISIONS  2.1 Authorisations  The impact of the UK withdrawal on authorisations depends on the type of authorisation including the issuing customs authority, the holder of the authorisation and the geographical coverage.  Authorisations granted by UK customs authorities As a rule, any authorisation already granted by UK customs authorities are no longer valid in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date. The customs authorities of the UK are no longer an EUcompetent customs authority as of that date.
hen the UK accedes to the Convention on a common transit procedure
(CTC) as a Contracting Party in its own right as of the withdrawal date
authorisations granted by the UK for transit simplifications10 will no longer be valid in the EU27 Customs Decisions system, but need to be treated in the UK's national system as a Contracting Party to the CTC.  Authorisations granted by the EU27 customs authorities In general, authorisations granted by an EU27 customs authority will remain valid but need to be amended by the customs authority on their own initiative or following an application to amend from the economic operator in view of the geographical coverage or elements of the authorisation related to the UK and be amended as appropriate.11 However, authorisations granted to economic operators with UK EORI numbers are no longer valid in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date, unless the

Authorisations for comprehensive guarantee including waiver and authorisation
to use the electronic transport document (ETD) as a transit declaration for goods carried by air as authorisations with a link to the EU27

economic operat
is established in the EU27, has the possibility to obtain an EU27 EORI and to apply for an amendment of the authorisation to include the new EU27 EORI instead of the UK EORI number. In order to facilitate the preparation by the stakeholders, it is also possible for the customs authority to amend authorisation
without a prior application. Th
authorisations granted to economic operators with EU27 EORI numbers, which are currently also valid in the UK need to be amended in order to take account of the withdrawal and the corresponding geographical coverage, e.g. in the authorisation concerning the Regular Shipping Service, the routes containing UK ports will have to be deleted.
Single Authorisation for Simplified Procedures (SASP) which today cover
the UK and a single MS will no longer be valid as of the withdrawal date. Nonetheless, it might be amended and could become a national authorisation
Where a SASP authorisation covers the UK and more than one EU27 Member State, that authorisation remains valid, but needs to be amended. In case the SASP authorisation covers simplified declarations, it should be noted that the economic operator needs to submit the supplementary declaration covering also the UK only for the period until the da
before the withdrawal date; a separate supplementary declaration covering the remaining Member States only has to be made for any remaining days of that calendar month
Authorisations to use the comprehensive guarantee where the guarantor is established in the UK will be suspended until the economic operator has replaced the UK guarantor by a guarantor established in the EU27
The use of the comprehensive guarantee requires a recalculation of the reference amount due to the changes of the customs status of the goods to be covered under common transit. Economic operators who currently do not require authorisations but whose situation will change as of the withdrawal date need to apply for the relevant authorisation. Operators who are currently holder
of authorisations granted by UK customs authorities and who draw the conclusion that they will meet the UCC requirements after the withdrawal need to apply for the relevant authorisations to the
27 customs authorities. The applications may already be submitted in advance of the withdrawal date to allow the competent customs authority to prepare taking the decision. In any case, the decision shall only take effect as of the withdrawal date at the earliest. This applies also to economic operators who are currently registered with a UK EORI, and have an EU27 Member State EORI number with a future starting date. In their case, however, the Customs Decision System (CDS) does not accept an EORI number, which will become valid only in the future, while it allows for a future validity date of the authorisation. Consequently, applications for authorisations, which are covered by CDS12 and submitted by those economic operators
have to be dealt with outside CDS. As of the withdrawal date, when the EORI becomes valid, the authorisation should be entered into the system.                                                            12 See Article 5 of Implementing Regulation 2017/2089, OJ L 297, 15.11.2017, p. 13.

2.2
ecision
relating to binding tariff information
BTI decisions
A decision relating to binding tariff information
BTI decision
is an official written decision issued by a customs authority which provides the applicant with an assessment of the classification of goods in the EU tariff nomenclature prior to an import or export procedure. The BTI decision is binding on all the EU customs authorities and the holder of the decision. The BTI decisions already issued by the customs authorities of the UK will no longer be valid in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date.  Any BTI applications submitted to the customs authorities of the UK or applications by or on behalf of persons holding a UK's EORI number made to the customs authorities of other Member States before the withdrawal date, but not processed before that date, shall not result in BTI decisions as of the withdrawal date.  The BTI decisions issued by the customs authorities of the EU27 Member States to holders with UK EORI numbers will no longer be valid as of the withdrawal date as the EORI numbers will no longer be valid in the customs territory of the Union and as BTI decisions may not be amended (Article 34(6) UCC). This will be reflected automatically in the EBTI-3 system. Those BTI decision holders shall register with the customs authorities in accordance with Article 9(2) and (3) UCC and Article 6 UCC DA to obtain a valid EORI number before applying for a new BTI decision in the EU27. The applicant could request a reissuing of his previous BTI decision by including a reference thereto in the application form.  2.3
ecision
relating to binding origin information
BOI decisions
A decision relating to binding origin information (BOI decision) is a written decision by a customs authority taken upon application, which provides its holder with a determination of the origin of goods prior to an import or export procedure. The BOI decision is binding on all the customs authorities in the EU and on the holder of the decision. The BOI decisions already issued by the customs authorities of the UK will no longer be valid in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date.  Any applications for BOI decisions submitted to the customs authorities of the UK or applications by or on behalf of persons holding a UK's EORI number made to the customs authorities of other Member States before the withdrawal date, but not processed before that date, shall not result in BOI decisions as of the withdrawal date.  In addition, with a view to taking BOI decisions as of the withdrawal date, the customs authorities of the EU27 shall not consider UK inputs (materials or processing operations) as having an 'EU origin' (for non-preferential purpose) or being of goods incorporating those inputs. The BOI decisions issued by the customs authorities of the EU27 to holders with UK EORI numbers will no longer be valid as of the withdrawal date, as the EORI numbers will no longer be valid in the customs territory of the Union insofar as BOI decisions
may not be amended (Article 34(6) UCC). Those BOI decision holders have the possibility to register with the customs authorities to obtain a valid EORI number before applying for a new BOI decision in the EU27. BOIs issued before the withdrawal date referred to goods including UK inputs (materials or processing operations) which were determinant for the acquisition of origin will no longer be valid as of the withdrawal date
3.
AGGAGE TAGS A baggage tag as set out in Annex 12-03 UCC IA may be affixed on hold baggage, which is scheduled to leave the UK with an aircraft before the withdrawal date, but arrives at an EU27 airport as of that date.  4.
ARIFF QUOTAS 4.1 First come-first served tariff quotas
equests by operators to benefit from Union tariff quotas according to the UCC which are based on declarations that have been accepted prior to the withdrawal date are eligible where the required supporting documents have been provided to the UK customs authorities prior to that date. Declarations accepted by the UK customs authorities as of the withdrawal date are not eligible to benefit from Union tariff quotas. Where the UK customs authorities have transmitted valid requests to the Commission without delay, the Commission will allocate quantities according to Article 51(2) UCC IA13 and will communicate the amounts allocated to the UK thereafter. 4.2 Tariff quotas managed by licences For licence-managed Union tariff quotas, the rights and obligations that arise from UK agricultural licences allocated by the licensing issuing authorities of the UK as well as those that were transferred to operators established in the UK will cease to be valid in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date. As of that date, EU27 customs administrations shall not any longer accept those licences.  Licences issued by EU27 licensing authorities will remain valid within the EU27, unless transferred to operators established in the UK. 5.
REFERENTIAL ORIGIN14 ASPECTS As of the withdrawal date the UK becomes a third country to which the EU preferential trade arrangements with third countries cease to apply.                                                            13
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447
f 24 November 2015 laying down detailed rules for implementing certain provisions of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Union Customs Code (OJ L 343, 29.12.2015, p. 558). 14
References to "originating" or "non-originating" in this section should be considered only in relation to preferential origin

5.1 Consideration of the preferential origin a) UK inputs As from the withdrawal date UK inputs (material or processing operations) are considered as 'non-originating' under preferential trade arrangements for the determination of the preferential origin of goods incorporating those inputs, in accordance with the Notice to stakeholders
Withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in the field of customs and external trade: Preferential origin of goods15   b) EU imports from the UK  Goods imported into the EU from the UK as of the withdrawal date will become non-originating goods for the purposes of their use under EU preferential arrangements. This means that:    i. Goods produced in the UK before the withdrawal date, if imported into the EU as of the withdrawal date, are not considered as EU originating for the purposes of their direct exportation, or exportation after further processing, to an EU preferential partner country. ii. Goods produced in the EU27 before the withdrawal date, if imported from the UK as of the withdrawal date
are not considered as EU originating for the purposes of their direct exportation, or exportation after further processing, to an EU preferential partner country. iii. Goods originating in preferential partner countries and imported into the UK before the withdrawal date in accordance with the preferences provided by EU trade preferential arrangements, if imported into the EU after withdrawal
are not considered as originating in the corresponding partner country. These goods can therefore not be used for cumulation purposes with that partner country (bilateral cumulation) or with other partner countries (diagonal cumulation) under the EU preferential arrangements.  c) EU exports to, and imports from, preferential partner countries via the UK  Goods imported as of the withdrawal date from the EU27 via the UK into a third country with which the EU has a preferential arrangement may be entitled for preferential treatment in that third partner country, provided that the provisions on direct transport/non-manipulation contained in the origin provisions of the relevant EU preferential arrangements are respected.  Similarly, goods imported as of the withdrawal date from EU partner countries into the EU via the UK may be entitled for preferential treatment in the EU provided that the provisions on direct transport/non-manipulation contained in the origin provisions of the relevant EU preferential arrangements are respected.                                                            15 https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/notice-to-stakeholders-brexit-preferential-origin-final_en.pdf

d) UK Overseas Countries and Territories  Materials originating and work or processing carried out in the UK Overseas Countries and Territories (Annex II TFEU), are not considered as originating when determining the origin of goods imported into the EU from other OCTs or from EU partner countries as from the withdrawal date. 5.2 Proofs of origin a) General principle:  In principle, proofs of origin can be issued or made out only if the products comply, at the time where the proofs are issued or made out, with the origin rules established in the relevant preferential trade agreement or arrangement. As of the withdrawal date, UK content will be considered as non-originating for the purposes of issuing or making out proofs of origin. Supporting documents (including proofs of origin and suppliers' declarations) can be relied upon for the issuance of proofs of origin on the condition that they do not concern UK content which is determinant for the acquisition of origin. Exporters and competent customs or other competent authorities issuing or making out such proofs of origin as of the withdrawal date are required to ascertain whether the supporting documents meet the conditions at the time of issuance of the proof.  b) Proofs of origin issued in the EU The following proofs of origin issued or made out before the withdrawal date in the EU remain valid, when the export of the consignment has been effected or ensured before the withdrawal date.
Proofs of origin issued or made out in the UK before the withdrawal date;
Proofs of origin issued or made out in the EU27 before the withdrawal date in relation to goods with a UK content;
Certificates of origin issued by EU27 customs authorities for UK exporters; Invoice declarations, origin declarations or statements on origin made out by UK exporters for the exportation of the EU originating products from the EU27 before the withdrawal date. The validity is limited to the period established under the relevant EU trade preferential arrangements, for the purpose of being used at importation in the partner country in accordance with the relevant provisions of the EU preferential arrangements. However, EU preferential partner countries may question such proofs of origin and request verification when they accompany goods imported in the preferential partner countries as of the withdrawal date. In these cases, the EU27 Member State customs authorities will reply, to verification requests, in accordance with the possibilities available to them to confirm the originating status of the goods or the authenticity of those proofs. For those purposes, the EU origin shall be determined as of the time
when the proofs were issued, in light of the principle described in the first paragraph above. c) Proofs of origin issued in the EU preferential partner countries Proofs of origin issued or made out in EU preferential partner countries before the withdrawal date in relation to goods with UK content which was determinant for the acquisition of the partner country origin, may be used for importation purposes in the EU during the period of its validity as provided under the relevant EU trade preferential arrangements, when the export of the consignment has been effected or ensured before the withdrawal date. However, UK content incorporated in goods with EU origin imported in the EU preferential partner countries and accompanied by a valid EU proof of origin may not be used in the EU preferential partner countries for cumulation purposes as of the withdrawal date.  5.3 Supplier's declarations for preferential trade purposes  Supplier's declarations are supporting documents on which basis proofs of origin can be issued. As of the withdrawal date, they can be relied upon for the issuance of proofs of origin on the condition that they do not include UK content which is determinant for the acquisition of origin. Exporters and competent customs or other competent authorities issuing or making out such proofs of origin as of the withdrawal date are required to ascertain whether supplier's declarations meet the conditions at the time of issuance of the proof. As of the withdrawal date:  Supplier's declarations made out by UK suppliers before the withdrawal date may not be used for the purposes of issuing or making out proofs of origin in EU27 Member States as of the withdrawal date.  Suppliers in EU27 Member States providing the exporter or the trader with the information necessary to determine the preferential origin status of goods through the originating status of the goods supplied before that date and for which they   In the case of long- the suppliers established in the EU27 should inform the exporter or trader if the long-term supplier's declaration is not valid any longer as of that date for all or some consignments covered by the long- 5.4 Exporters under preferential trade As of the withdrawal date, the following aspects should be considered: a) With respect to approved exporters for the purposes of making out invoice declarations or origin declarations in accordance with the relevant provisions on preferential origin of the Union:
10
Authorisations granted by UK customs authorities to exporters and re-consignors to be approved exporters are no longer valid in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date.   Authorisations granted by EU27 customs authorities to exporters and re-consignors established in the UK are no longer valid in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date
Authorisations granted by EU27 customs authorities to exporters and re-consignors established in the EU27 with a UK EORI number are no longer valid in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date
EU approved exporters and re-consignors established in the EU27 should inform the concerned national customs authority regarding changes on the fulfilment of the conditions subject to which they were authorised, considering that UK content will be non-originating as of the withdrawal date. Accordingly, EU27 customs authorities which authorised those exporters and re-consignors as approved exporters will amend or withdraw the authorisation as appropriate. b) With respect to registered exporters (REX) for the purposes of making out invoice declarations or origin declarations in accordance with the relevant provisions on preferential origin of the Union:  Registration by UK customs authorities of exporters and re-consignors in REX are no longer valid in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date.   Registrations by EU27 customs authorities to exporters and re-consignors established in the UK are no longer valid in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date.  Registrations by EU27 customs authorities to exporters and re-consignors established in the EU27 with a UK EORI number are no longer valid in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date
EU registered exporters and re-consignors established in the EU27 should inform immediately the concerned national customs authority on any relevant change relating to information they provided for the purposes of their registration. Accordingly, EU27 customs authorities which have registered those exporters and re-consignors will revoke the registration if the conditions for being registered are no longer met. 5.5 Origin quota derogations established in certain EU FTAs  Since origin quota derogations are covered by Article 56(4) UCC, the same rules as those for tariff quotas in Section 4.1 will apply.  6.
ALUATION As of the withdrawal date, for the goods produced in the UK using assists16 and imported into the EU27 after that date, the value of those assists will have to be added                                                            16

NTRY OF GOODS INTO THE CUSTOMS TERRITORY OF THE UNION 7.1 Entry summary declaration (ENS) Goods brought from the UK into the customs territory of the Union as of the withdrawal date shall be covered by an entry summary declaration (ENS), where required, which has to be lodged within the time-limits set out in the UCC DA18. That covers also the goods moving between two points in the customs territory of the Union via the UK.
transit declaration comprising all security and safety data may be used to comply with ENS requirements and subject to time-limits being respected, e.g. where common transit is used
Where an ENS was lodged at the customs office of first entry in the UK before the withdrawal date, it will not remain valid for subsequent ports or airports in the EU27 where the goods are arriving as of that date. The economic operator shall lodge a new ENS covering all goods arriving in the EU27. Where in those cases the operator could not comply with the respective time-limits, the ENS lodgement should be accepted. Where an ENS was lodged at the customs office of first entry in the EU27 before the withdrawal date, with subsequent ports located in the UK and in the EU27, and where the vessel after calling at a UK port arrives in a subsequent EU27 port as of the withdrawal date, an ENS for all goods on the vessel shall be lodged. The same applies in case of diversions. Goods covered by an ENS, which had been lodged before the withdrawal date with a customs office in the UK, were diverted and arrive in the EU27 instead as of the withdrawal date. In such case, the previous ENS will be deleted by the system and deemed not having been lodged after 200 days and the economic operator has to lodge a new ENS for the goods then brought to the EU27.  In the specific cases where goods leave the UK directly for the EU27 before the withdrawal date and arrive in the customs territory of the Union as of that date, no ENS is required.  7.2 Temporary storage of goods (TS) Authorisations for the operation of temporary storage facilities granted by the UK customs authorities will cease to be valid in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date. Authorisations granted by the EU27 customs authorities including the possibility to move goods to a temporary facility in the UK will have to be amended to exclude such possibility as of the withdrawal date.                                                             17
The value of assists, apportioned as appropriate, has to be added to the price when they are supplied directly or indirectly by the buyer/importer for use in connection with the production and sale for export of the imported goods, to the extent that their value has not been included in the price actually paid or payable. 18

Where goods in TS covered by an authorisation for the operation of TS facilities granted by the UK customs authorities will be moving between a temporary storage facility in the UK and another one in the EU27 and will arrive at the EU27 border as of the withdrawal date, those goods will be treated as non-Union goods brought to the customs territory of the Union from a third country. Where those goods arrive in the EU27 already before the withdrawal date, but their movement to an EU27 TS facility is intended to continue as of that date, that movement will not be covered by a valid authorisation. Therefore, temporary storage for those goods should end before the withdrawal date (e.g. by placing the goods under a customs procedure or re-exporting them). If such regularisation does not take place, there will be a non-compliance of the obligations laid down in the customs legislation concerning the introduction of non-Union goods into the customs territory of the Union and therefore Article 79 UCC will apply, i.e. a customs debt due to non-compliance will incur. In the case of goods in TS covered by an authorisation granted by the EU27 customs authorities and located in the UK as of the withdrawal date, such goods will be deemed to have been re-exported. 7.3 Customs status of goods As a general rule, for Union goods which are moving as intra
nion movement from the UK around the withdrawal date, their treatment will depend on when they enter the customs territory of the Union: where they enter the EU27 before the withdrawal date, they will keep their customs status of Union goods; where they arrive at the EU27 external border as of the withdrawal date, they will be treated as any other third-country goods.  For Union goods moving between two points in the customs territory of the Union via the UK, where the movement starts as an intra-Union movement, a proof of Union status shall be accepted where those goods re-enter the customs territory of the Union only as of the withdrawal date after having crossed the UK. Besides that, any formalities required for goods re-entering the customs territory of the Union will be required, e.g. ENS. Where Union goods are carried by air and have been loaded or transhipped at a UK airport for consignment to an EU27 airport and are carried under a single transport document (STD) according to Article 119(2)(a) UCC DA issued in the UK and that movement actually leaves the UK airport before the withdrawal date and arrive
at an EU27 airport on the withdrawal date, those goods will keep their Union status
This will be practically relevant only for aircraft leaving from a UK airport in the late hours before 00:00 CET on the withdrawal date on a direct flight to an EU27 airport and arriving there after 00:00 CET on the withdrawal date
Where Union goods are carried by sea on a vessel assigned to a regular shipping service and the vessel called within an ongoing voyage at a UK port and left that UK port actually before the withdrawal date and arrived directly  at an EU27 port as of the withdrawal date, i.e. without calling at any other port in a territory outside the customs territory of the Union or at any free zone in a Union port, and has not made any transhipments of goods at sea, those goods will keep their Union status. Where Union goods are carried by sea on a non-regular shipping service vessel and that vessel leaves a UK port actually before the withdrawal date for an EU27 port and  13
arrives at that port as of the withdrawal date, a proof of the customs status of Union goods shall be accepted.  Where motorised road vehicles registered in an EU27 Member State are returning from the UK and re-enter the customs territory of the Union, Article 208 UCC IA applies. To goods in baggage carried by a passenger arriving from the UK Article 210 UCC IA applies. Where packaging with Union status is returning from the UK as of the withdrawal date, its Union status shall be considered as proven in accordance with the rules set out in Article 209 UCC IA. 7.4
elief from import duty Returned goods Where Union goods were temporarily exported from the UK before the withdrawal and are re-imported in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date complying with the conditions established in Article 203 UCC, those goods shall be considered returned goods and hence be imported with total relief.  Where Union goods are brought from the EU27 to the UK before the withdrawal date and where then such goods move back to the EU27 as of the withdrawal date, the provisions on returned goods referred to in Article 203 UCC should apply if the economic operator can provide evidence that the Union goods:  were transported to the UK prior to the withdrawal date; and   return in an unaltered state in accordance with Article 203(5) UCC and Article 158 UCC DA.  The withdrawal of the UK as such, however, may not be used as special circumstances in order to exceed the three-year period referred to in Article 203(1) UCC. The proof that the Union goods were brought to the UK prior to the withdrawal date should be provided in particular by the respective transport documents and, if necessary, accompanied by other relevant documents (e.g. a lease contract). Where applicable, a proof may be required that the state of the goods has not been altered.  Duty Relief Regulation Concerning the duty relief for personal property belonging to natural persons transferring their normal place of residence from a third country to the Union, Article 5 of the Duty Relief Regulation19 foresees a continuous period of at least twelve months at a normal place of residence outside the customs territory of the Union for duty-free treatment.  For that personal property as well as for other categories of goods covered by the Duty Relief Regulation, e.g. goods imported on the occasion of a marriage set out in Article 12 Duty Relief Regulation, the requested periods, e.g. the period of residence,                                                            19

may include also the period of application of that Regulation. 8.
PECIAL PROCEDURES 8.1 Transit Union/common transit procedures As of the withdrawal date, the UK accedes to the Convention on a common transit procedure20 (CTC) in its own right, hence it may use common transit and continue to have access to the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS
as a Contracting Party to the CTC. Consequently, the transit operations ongoing at the time of the withdrawal shall continue in the NCTS.  Situations where goods were released for a transit procedure in the EU27 or in a common transit country or in the UK and are moving to, from or via the UK:  a) Goods moving under a transit operation from a customs office of departure in the EU27 or in a common transit country to a customs office of destination in the UK
Where goods are placed under a Union transit procedure in the EU27 or under a common transit procedure in a common transit country with destination in the UK and those goods are still located in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date, that Union transit procedure will continue as a common transit procedure in the UK
The customs office of entry in the UK will play the role of a customs office of transit, i.e. it shall request the relevant data from the customs office of departure and fulfil all tasks of a customs office of transit. At the external EU27 border an exit summary declaration (EXS
has to be lodged
or security and safety purposes, unless the particulars necessary for risk analysis for security and safety purposes have already been provided with the transit declaration or the obligation to lodge a pre-departure declaration is waived under the UCC.  Where the goods are already located in the UK as of the withdrawal date, the transit movement will continue to the customs office of destination. b) Goods moving under a transit operation from a customs office of departure in the UK to a customs office of destination in the EU27 or in a common transit country  Where goods are placed under a Union transit procedure in the UK with destination in the EU27 or in a common transit country and the goods are still located in the UK as of the withdrawal date, that Union transit procedure will continue as a common transit procedure to the destination in the EU27 or in the common transit country
The customs office of entry in the EU27 will play the role of a customs office of transit, i.e., it shall request the relevant data from the customs office of departure and fulfil all tasks of a customs office of transit. At the external EU27 border an ENS has to be                                                            20

lodged for security and safety purposes, unless the particulars necessary for the ENS have already been provided with the transit declaration or the obligation to lodge an ENS is waived under the UCC.  Where the goods are already located in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date, that transit procedure continues to the destination in the EU27 or in the common transit country
c) Goods moving under a transit operation via the UK
Where goods move between a customs office of departure in an EU27 Member State or in a common transit country via the UK to a customs office of destination in an EU27 Member State or in a common transit country and those goods are still located in the EU2
or in a common transit country as of the withdrawal date, that transit procedure will continue as a common transit procedure in the UK
The customs office of entry in the UK and the customs office of entry in the respective Member State where the movement re-enters the customs territory of the Union, respectively, will play the role of customs offices of transit. They shall request the relevant data from the customs office of departure and fulfil all tasks of a customs office of transit. When leaving the EU27 territory (before entering to the UK) an EXS has to be lodged, unless the particulars necessary for risk analysis for security and safety purposes have already been provided with the transit declaration or the obligation to lodge a pre-departure declaration is waived under the UCC.  Where the goods have crossed the UK and re-entered the customs territory of the EU27 or of a common transit country before the withdrawal date, that transit operation will continue until its destination.  Where the goods covered by a transit declaration are crossing the UK at the time of the withdrawal or have crossed and left the UK, but have not yet re-entered the customs territory of the EU27 by the time of the withdrawal, the customs office of entry into the EU27 will act as a customs office of transit. It shall request the relevant data from the customs office of departure and fulfil all tasks of a customs office of transit. At the external EU27 border an ENS has to be lodged, unless the particulars necessary for the ENS have already been provided with the transit declaration or the obligation to lodge an ENS is waived under the UCC
Customs authorities may, for a period up to one year after UK accession to the CTC, continue to accept existing forms of the guarant undertaking
and guarantee certificates21 subject to the necessary geographical adaptations made manually and approved authorities themselves (in case of guarantee certificates). By the end of that period, the holder of that procedure must provide a new undertaking according to the modified model. Where an enquiry or recovery procedure was started, but not ended at the time of withdrawal, it is continued in the NCTS.                                                            21

Electronic transport document (ETD) used as a transit declaration for goods carried by air or sea Where goods are placed under an ETD transit procedure in the EU27 or in a common transit country with destination in the UK and the goods do not arrive in the UK before the withdrawal date that procedure will continue as an ETD common transit procedure to the UK airport of arrival as of that date.
Where goods are placed under an ETD transit procedure in the UK with destination in the EU27 or in a common transit country and the goods do not arrive in the EU27 or in the common transit country before the withdrawal date that procedure will continue to the airport in the EU27 or in a common transit country as of that date. Where goods are carried by sea under an ETD transit procedure between the UK and the EU27 and the regular shipping service vessel ha
left the UK port before the withdrawal date and arrived directly at an EU27 port as of the withdrawal date
i.e. without calling at any other port in a territory outside the customs territory of the Union or at any free zone in a Union port, and has not made any transhipments of goods at sea, the transit procedure will continue to its EU27 destination
Movement of goods under the TIR operations The UK (as all other Member States) is already today a Contracting Party to the TIR Convention22 will no longer be part of the customs territory of the Union, border formalities will apply to TIR operations. Although the UK will have access to the NCTS as a Contracting Party to the CTC, that access does not cover the use of the NCTS for TIR operations. a) Goods moving under a TIR operation from a customs office of departure/entry in the EU27 to a customs office of destination/exit in the UK Where goods are placed under a TIR procedure in the EU27 with destination/exit in the UK and those goods are still located in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date, that TIR procedure will, at the latest, be terminated for the Union territory at the customs office of the physical exit from the EU27. That office will become the customs office of destination/exit. It shall request the relevant data from the customs office of departure and fulfil all tasks of a customs office of destination/exit23. For the exit of the goods at the external border of the EU27, an EXS is to be lodged, unless the particulars necessary for risk analysis for security and safety purposes have already been provided or the obligation to lodge a pre-departure declaration is waived under the UCC.  Where the goods are already located in the UK or have left but not yet arrived in the UK as of the withdrawal date, the TIR movement will be subject to UK customs law and to the TIR Convention. However, the UK customs office of destination/exit will                                                            22

not be able to send any NCTS TIR messages to the customs office of departure/entry located in the EU27 and thus this office will not be able to discharge those TIR operations in the NCTS with the usual electronic messages. Therefore, the holders of the procedure will have to provide an alternative proof of terminating the TIR procedure, and the customs office will have to terminate and discharge the operation manually.  b) Goods moving under a TIR operation from a customs office of departure/entry in the UK to a customs office of destination/exit in the EU27  Where goods are placed under a TIR procedure in the UK with destination in the EU27 and the goods are still located in the UK as of the withdrawal date, that TIR movement cannot continue until the destination in the EU27. When the goods arrive at a customs office at the external EU27 border, the operation will be treated as any TIR operation coming from a third country and formalities established for those goods will apply24. An ENS has to be lodged at entry into the EU27 at the UK/EU27 border, unless the particulars necessary for the ENS have already been provided or the obligation to lodge an ENS is waived under the UCC. In the NCTS, the transit procedure started in the UK cannot be closed with the usual IE messages, the UK will have to write it off manually. A new NCTS TIR movement has to be lodged by the operator with the customs office at the external EU27 border which will act as a custom
office of departure/entry for the TIR operation within the EU.  Where goods are placed under a TIR procedure in the UK with destination in the EU27 and the goods are already located in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date, that TIR movement can continue until the destination in the EU27. When the goods arrive at a customs office of destination/exit, the operation will be treated as any other TIR operation. c) Goods moving under a TIR operation via the UK
Where goods move between a customs office of departure/entry in an EU27 Member State via the UK to a customs office of destination/exit in an EU27 Member and those goods are still located in the EU27, before crossing the UK, the following applies: as of the withdrawal date, that TIR procedure shall, at the latest, be terminated at the customs office of exit from the EU27. This office then becomes the customs office of destination/exit. The "new
customs offices of destination/exit will request the relevant data from the customs office of departure and fulfil all tasks of a customs office of destination/exit. For the exit of the goods at the external border of the EU27, an EXS is to be lodged, unless the particulars necessary for risk analysis for security and safety purposes have already been provided or the obligation to lodge a pre-departure declaration is waived under the UCC. Where the goods have crossed the UK and re-entered the customs territory of the EU27 before the withdrawal date the TIR movement can continue until destination.                                                            24

Where the goods covered by a TIR Carnet are crossing the UK by the time of the withdrawal, the following applies: the goods arriving at the EU27 external border will have to be treated as any other TIR movement coming from a third country and formalities established for those goods will apply. An ENS has to be lodged before entering the customs territory of the EU27 again at the UK/EU27 border unless the particulars necessary for the ENS have already been provided or the obligation to lodge an ENS is waived under the UCC. However, in the NCTS, the TIR procedure started in the EU27 Member State could continue. 8.2 Special procedures other than transit Customs warehousing (CW) UK authorisations for customs warehousing are no longer valid in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date, including those which allow for the movement of goods between different customs warehouses. The same will apply to authorisations for movements of goods from customs warehousing facilities located in the EU27 to customs warehousing facilities locate
in the UK included in customs warehousing authorisations  granted by the EU27 customs authorities (see Article 179(3) UCC DA).  Where goods stored in a UK customs warehouse are brought to the EU27 as of the withdrawal date, they have to fulfil the customs formalities established in the UCC for non-Union goods entering the customs territory of the Union from outside this territory (i.e. ENS, temporary storage declaration and customs declaration).
here goods will be moving between a customs warehouse in the UK and another one in the EU27 and arrive in the EU27 within a short period before the withdrawal date without sufficient time to reach the destination, and their movement continues in the EU27
as of that date those goods are not covered by an authorisation valid in the EU27. Therefore, the concerned economic operator should discharge this procedure before the withdrawal date (e.g. by placing the goods under a subsequent customs procedure). Such subsequent procedure may be CW as well, provided that the goods are covered by a valid authorisation granted by the EU27 customs authorities. If such regularisation does not take place, the concerned goods would not comply with the obligations laid down in the customs legislation concerning the storage of such goods within the customs territory of the Union and therefore Article 79 UCC will apply, i.e. a customs debt due to non-compliance will incur
If goods placed under CW located in the EU27 are brought to the UK before the withdrawal date (i.e. because the movement was authorised by the customs authorities) and such goods are located in the UK as of the withdrawal date, the CW procedure will be deemed to have been discharged (i.e. the goods would be considered to be taken out of the customs territory of the Union). The economic operator concerned should provide a proof, if requested by the customs authorities, showing that the goods were brought to the UK before the withdrawal date (e.g. a transport document).
Free zones  Where goods placed under a free zone procedure in the UK are brought to the EU27 as of the withdrawal date, they have to fulfil the customs formalities established in the  19
UCC for non-Union goods entering the customs territory of the Union from outside this territory (i.e. ENS, temporary storage declaration and customs declaration)
Temporary admission (TA) Any authorisations granted by the UK customs authorities to place goods under TA before the withdrawal date will not be valid in the EU27 as of that date. The procedure for goods moved under those authorisations according to Article 219 UCC to the EU27 and located in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date should be discharged before that date, so the goods have to be a) re-exported, b) placed under a subsequent customs procedure, c) destroyed with no waste remaining, or d) abandoned to the State. Such subsequent procedure may be TA as well, provided that the goods are covered by a valid authorisation granted by the EU27 customs authorities. If such discharge does not take place, the concerned goods would not comply with the obligations laid down in the customs legislation concerning the TA of such goods within the customs territory of the Union and therefore Article 79 UCC will apply, i.e. a customs debt due to non-compliance will incur. Where goods placed under temporary admission (TA) covered by an authorisation granted by the EU27 before the withdrawal date are located in the UK customs territory as of that date, and are brought from the UK to the EU27, they have to comply with the customs formalities established in the UCC for goods entering the customs territory of the Union from outside this territory (i.e. ENS, temporary storage declaration and customs declaration).  Where goods placed under TA in the EU27 are moved to the UK before the withdrawal date and such goods are located in the UK as of the withdrawal date, the TA procedure will be deemed to have been discharged (i.e. the goods would be considered to be taken out of the customs territory of the Union). The economic operator concerned should provide a proof, if requested by the customs authorities, showing that the goods were brought to the UK before the withdrawal date (e.g. a transport document).
End-use (E-U) Any authorisations granted by the UK customs authorities to place goods under E-U before the withdrawal date will not be valid in the EU27 as of that date. The procedure for goods covered by those authorisations and located in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date should be discharged before that date, so the goods have to be a) taken out of the customs territory of the Union, b) used for the purposes laid down for the application of the duty exemption or reduced rate of duty, c) destroyed with or without waste remaining, or d) abandoned to the State. The same applies in the case of authorisations for Transfer of Rights and Obligations (TORO) and for movement of goods as established in Articles 218 and 219 UCC. If the discharge mentioned above does not take place, the concerned goods would not comply with the obligations laid down in the customs legislation concerning the E-U of such goods within the customs territory of the Union and therefore Article 79 UCC will apply, i.e. a customs debt due to non-compliance will incur. Where goods placed under end-use (E-U) before the withdrawal date are located in the UK customs territory as of that date, and move therefrom to the EU27, they have to  20
comply with customs formalities applicable to any other third-country goods (i.e. ENS, temporary storage declaration and customs declaration).  Where goods placed under E-U in the EU27 are moved to the UK before the withdrawal date, and such goods are located in the UK as of the withdrawal date, the
U procedure will be deemed to have been discharged (i.e. the goods would be considered to be taken out of the customs territory of the Union). The economic operator concerned should provide a proof, if requested by the customs authorities, showing that the goods were brought to the UK before the withdrawal date (e.g. a transport document).
Inward processing (IP) Any authorisations granted by the UK customs authorities to place goods under IP before the withdrawal date will not be valid in the EU27 as of that date. The procedure for goods moved under those authorisations according to Article 219 UCC to the EU27 and located in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date should be discharged before that date, so the goods have to be a) re-exported, b) placed under a subsequent customs procedure, c) destroyed with no waste remaining, or d) abandoned to the State. Such subsequent procedure may be IP as well, provided that the goods are covered by a valid authorisation granted by the EU27 customs authorities. If such discharge does not take place, the concerned goods would not comply with the obligations laid down in the customs legislation concerning the processing of such goods within the customs territory of the Union and therefore Article 79 UCC will apply, i.e. a customs debt due to non-compliance will incur. Where goods placed under inward processing (IP) before the withdrawal date are located in the UK customs territory as of that date, and are brought from the UK to the EU27, they have to comply with the customs formalities established in the UCC for goods entering the customs territory of the Union from outside this territory (i.e. ENS, temporary storage declaration and customs declaration)
In case of an IP EX/IM authorisation granted by UK customs authorities, if equivalent goods are exported before the withdrawal date, the equivalent amount of goods (raw material) should be brought to the customs territory of the Union with total relief from import duty before the withdrawal date. Otherwise, if the equivalent goods were brought to the customs territory of the Union as of the withdrawal date, they would be treated as third country goods entering the EU territory and the relevant import duties would apply. Where goods placed under IP in the EU27 are moved to the UK before the withdrawal date, and such goods are located in the UK a
of the withdrawal date, the IP procedure will be deemed to have been discharged (i.e. the goods would be considered to be taken out of the customs territory of the Union). The economic operator concerned should provide a proof
if requested by the customs authorities
showing that the goods were brought to the UK before the withdrawal date (e.g. a transport document).  Outward processing (OP) Any authorisations granted by the UK customs authorities to place goods under OP before the withdrawal date will not be valid in the EU27 as of that date. If the  21
processed products resulting from goods placed under OP (authorisation granted by UK authorities) were not brought to the UK, but to the EU27, as of the withdrawal date, such processed products must comply with the customs formalities established in the UCC for non-Union goods brought to the customs territory of the Union. Such products cannot benefit from OP (i.e. the calculation of import duty cannot be done according to Article 86(5) UCC). In case of an OP IM/EX authorisation granted by UK customs authorities, if equivalent goods are brought to the customs territory of the Union before the withdrawal date, the equivalent amount of goods (raw material) should be exported within the time limit of the authorisation. If such export does not take place, this would entail a non-compliance with the obligations laid down in the customs legislation concerning the OP procedure and therefore Article 79 UCC will apply, i.e. a customs debt due to non-compliance will incur
9.
OODS TAKEN OUT OF THE CUSTOMS TERRITORY OF THE UNION  9.1 Pre-departure declaration According to Article 263(3) UCC, the pre-departure declaration takes the form of either (i) a customs declaration for goods to be taken out of the customs territory of the Union; (ii) a re-export declaration; or (iii) an EXS. In most cases, the pre-departure declaration will be provided in the form of a customs declaration.  Where a pre-departure declaration was lodged and, where applicable, goods were released in the UK before the withdrawal date, that declaration will not be valid where those goods enter the EU27 as of the withdrawal date to exit via the EU27 and a new pre-departure declaration will be required for those goods in the form of a re-export declaration or of an EXS, which has to be lodged within the time-limits set out in the UCC DA.25 9.2 Export and re-export Where Union goods are to be brought from the EU27 to the UK and the economic operator has no knowledge whether the goods are taken out of the EU27 before the withdrawal date, those goods may only be placed under the export procedure at any designated customs office in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date. a) Export from the EU27 crossing the UK or with a customs office of exit in the UK  Where goods were released for export from the EU27 before the withdrawal date and are carried to the customs office of exit in the UK or cross the UK on their way to a customs office of exit in another EU27 Member State, there are the following possible scenarios:  i. Where the goods on their way to the UK customs office of exit are still located in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date, the previously foreseen customs office                                                            25

to be replaced by a customs office of exit located at the EU27 border (the diversion of the export movement is executed in ECS). This customs office will confirm the physical exit of the goods and send the respective message to the customs office of export. The same applies to goods on their way to an EU27 customs office of exit which are before crossing the UK still in the customs territory of the Union. ii. Where the goods on their way to the UK customs office of exit are already located in the UK as of the withdrawal date, the UK will not be able to send any messages via ECS confirming the physical exit of the goods. The customs office of export located in the EU27 will have to close the movement in ECS based on an alternative proof. Economic operators need to provide alternative proofs to the customs office of export in order to close the movement. iii. Where the goods already have crossed the UK on their way to a customs office of exit located in another Member State, there will be no impact on the current procedure (i.e. the customs office of exit at the external EU27 border will still confirm the physical exit of the goods to the customs office of export).  b) Export from the UK with a customs office of exit located in the EU27 iv. Where goods released for export from the UK with
customs office of exit in the EU27 are still located in the UK as of the withdrawal date, they will be subject to UK customs procedures when exiting the UK. When those goods enter the customs territory of the Union as of the withdrawal date, they will be treated as any other third country goods, i.e. an ENS shall be lodged at the first entry point of the EU27, the goods will have to be placed in temporary storage and, to reach the customs office of exit, they can be placed under external transit procedure. When the goods have reached the EU27 customs office of exit, then a re-export notification, a re-export declaration or an EXS at the EU27 customs office of exit should be lodged.  v. Where goods released for export in the UK via an EU27 customs office of exit are already located in the EU27 as of the withdrawal date and reach the envisaged EU27 customs office of exit, that customs office will not be able to confirm the physical exit of the goods to the UK customs office of export, as the UK will be disconnected from the ECS as of the withdrawal date. The customs office of exit should, upon request from the economic operator, issue a proof of exit (e.g. in the form of endorsement of the EAD).  10.
USTOMS CONTROLS ON IPR, SAFETY
HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT Safety, health and environment EU legislation requires goods imported in the EU, in transit or exported outside the EU to comply with a number of safety, health and environmental rules. It is the role of customs to check if goods entering or leaving the EU comply with all those rules. As of the withdrawal date, the goods brought to the customs territory of the Union from the UK or taken out from the customs territory of the Union to the UK will be subject to those rules.  The controls on the compliance with those rules can include documentary checks on import/export licences for certain goods as well as physical checks on the goods and  23
involves close cooperation and coordination with competent authorities who are responsible for the correct application of the relevant legislative requirements. It is important to emphasise that customs will only release the goods once the relevant competent authority has fully completed their controls and this has been communicated to customs via the established procedures (e.g. authorisations, licences, electronic data communication system between customs and competent authority, etc.). Import / export licences for certain goods Economic operators engaged in shipments of goods which are subject to import/export licences or which may become subject to import/export licences as of the withdrawal date are reminded of the legal repercussions which need to be considered when the UK becomes a third country. They should confirm that their goods meet all licencing obligations in order to prepare for possible changes as a result of no deal.  Further details on the consequences of withdrawal in the field of import / export licences for certain goods can be found in the "Notice to Stakeholders on the Withdrawal of the UK and EU rules in the field of import / export licences for certain goods
published on 25 January 201826 and in sectorial preparedness notices, such as the "Notice to stakeholders  withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU waste law"27
the "Notice to stakeholders  withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in the field of export and import of hazardous chemicals"28, and the "Notice to stakeholders  withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules on trade in protected species of wild fauna and flora"29. All preparedness notices are available, in all official languages of the EU, on the "Brexit preparedness website"30 of the Commission. On 19 December 2018, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation31 that would add the UK to the list of third countries covered by the EU General Authorisation 001 that lifts the requirements for individual licenses when trading in dual-use items. Intellectual Property Rights For the enforcement of IPR, as of the withdrawal date the EU rules on customs enforcement of intellectual property rights, and in particular Regulation (EU) No 608/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 2013 concerning customs enforcement of intellectual property rights, no longer apply to the UK. Further details on the consequences of withdrawal in particular on the submission and validity of Union applications for action can be found in the "Notice to Stakeholders                                                             26

EUROPEAN COMMISSION DIRECTORATE-GENERAL TAXATION AND CUSTOMS UNION
Brussels, 11 March 2019
UIDANCE NOTE
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND ASPECTS OF EXCISE IN RELATION TO MOVEMENT OF GOODS ONGOING ON THE WITHDRAWAL DATE The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that as from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET)
the United Kingdom will be a third country
This guidance note addresses a situation where the UK becomes a third country on the withdrawal date without a withdrawal agreement and hence without a transition period provided for in the draft Withdrawal Agreement.
As of the withdrawal date, the Union rules in the field of excise no longer apply to the UK. The UK will be treated as any other third country and the rules in the field of excise will apply as of that date. Furthermore, the UK will no longer have access to the EU excise IT systems. This guidance note provides guidance on the consequences of this for the cross-border intra-EU movement of excise goods between the UK and EU27, which started before the withdrawal date and will end thereafter. This document covers as well as the related features (e.g. registration and authorisations of economic operators, administrative cooperation). This document should be read in conjunction with the Guidance Note on customs issues.
Intra-EU cross-border movements of excise goods are subject to conditions and procedures specified in Directive 2008/118/EC and its related implementing regulations. Excise goods may be moved under duty suspension or while already released for consumption ("duty paid"). In the former case (duty suspension), registration and

n accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
Cf. Part four of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (OJ, C 66 I, 19.2.2019, p. 1

See also the "Notices to stakeholders" published by the Commission services in the area of EU customs law (https://ec.europa.eu/info/brexit/brexit-preparedness/preparedness-notices_en#tradetaxud).
authorisation of Economic Operators are pre-requisite; moreover, the procedures are computer-based and supported by pan-European IT systems called EMCS
for movement control and SEED
for registering excise economic operators. The withdrawal of the UK may have an impact for Economic Operators involved in the intra-EU cross-border movements of excise goods to, from, and via the UK. In particular, consignors, consignees, and guarantors should prepare for a withdrawal of the UK without a withdrawal agreement and examine their new obligations and liabilities as of the withdrawal date
1.
VERVIEW OF THE EXCISE CONSEQUENCES OF A O DEAL WITHDRAWAL OF THE UK 1.1. General Principles Excise goods that enter the excise territory of the EU from the UK or are dispatched or transported from the excise territory of the EU to the UK will respectively be treated as importation or exportation of excise goods in accordance with Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty
Goods in transit crossing the UK land bridge between Ireland and the rest of the European Union will also be subject to additional customs formalities. 1.2. Pan-European IT system EMCS The Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) on its own will no longer be applicable to excise duty suspended movements of excise goods from the EU into the UK, but those movements will be treated as exports, where excise supervision ends at the place of exit from the EU. Movements of excise goods to the UK will therefore require an export declaration as well as an electronic administrative document (e-AD). In case of movements of excise goods from the UK to the EU customs formalities will have to be completed before a movement under EMCS can begin
1.3. Customs Formalities If economic operators wish to continue moving excise goods to the UK or receiving goods from the UK they will need to familiarise themselves with customs formalities and should be prepared to register with the customs authorities in the Member State where they are established, in order to be assigned an EORI number, if they do not already have one. Nothing prevents those economic operators submitting the required data for the registration (Annex 12-01 UCC-DA)
before the withdrawal date. Further details can be

NGOING INTRA
NION CROSS-BORDER MOVEMENTS An  is an intra-Union cross-border movement of excise goods that began but did not end before the withdrawal date. 2.1. General Principles As of the withdrawal date:  Unless explicitly stated otherwise in this document, UK authorisations and decisions are no longer valid in EU27. Consequently, any e-AD11, SAAD12 or fallback excise document approved by the UK competent authority before the withdrawal date is no longer a valid proof of Union status for the goods.  No electronic messages can be exchanged between the UK and EU27 Member States via EU-managed communication platforms such as CCN; consequently, no EMCS message and no CCN Mail message may be exchanged between the UK and EU27 Member States
No new intra-EU movement of excise goods to or from the UK may start; a corollary is that no new e-AD or SAAD may be assigned for such movements.  Unless explicitly stated otherwise in this document, all ongoing movements of excise goods from or to the UK will be considered as movements from or to a third country with all applicable consequences (e.g. status of non-Union goods, applicable customs procedures, excise duty claims, or seizing of the goods in case of non-compliance). Attention is drawn to the fact that Economic Operators, who start intra-Union cross-border movement of excise goods to/from the UK just before the withdrawal date, run a significant risk as that they can no longer be ended appropriately as mentioned in the following sections. This will generate a significant administrative burden for all stakeholders, with a risk of irregularities.  Moreover, if the excise goods arrive at destination before the

electronic Administrative Document 12
Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document
withdrawal date, Economic Operators should submit the report of receipt or SAAD Copy 3 (where applicable) as soon as possible to ensure the excise movement is also completed before the withdrawal date.  Moreover, stakeholders involved in an excise movement to or from the UK that is at risk not to be completed before the withdrawal date should take contingency measures (e.g. contact exporters or importers where appropriate) in due time, taking into account the distance between the UK and the EU27 Member States.13 2.2. Excise goods under Duty Suspension For ongoing movement
of excise goods under duty suspension to, from or through the UK:  Unless explicitly stated otherwise in this document,
Reports of Receipt or of Export cannot be electronically exchanged and fallback documents are no longer automatically mutually recognised between EU27 and the UK;
Ongoing EMCS movements will have to be closed by ad-hoc means (e.g. Manual Closure); alternate evidence of exit of the EU27 territory may be used to this purpose. Annex I  Recommended alternate evidence of exit
The data in fallback Administrative Documents related to excise movements from or to the UK may not be inserted into EMCS as of the withdrawal date as the UK will no longer be a valid Member State in this IT system. This exceptional case can cause an excise movement to remain partly or totally outside of EMCS.  As of the withdrawal date, the consignor authorisation required under Council Directive 2008/118/EC issued by the UK is no longer valid. However, if excise goods from the UK are in the EU27 territory on the withdrawal date
Member States should consider such movements as valid and they should be allowed to be closed normally14
If excise goods from the UK have not entered the EU27 before the withdrawal date, then the excise movement cannot be completed normally. The excise goods would be subject to customs formalities applicable to imports and subject to excise duty at importation, or would need to be placed in a tax warehouse or a new EMCS movement started for the place of importation under the responsibility of a registered consignor authorised in the Member State of importation
Alternatively an external transit movement, as provided                                                  13
For instance, a movement between the UK and Malta can take more than one month
14
E.g. via a Report of Receipt from the EU27 consignee or via a Report of Export from the EU27 Member State of Export; this report of receipt/export cannot however be forwarded to the UK, which was still the Member State of Dispatch at the beginning of the excise movement.
under the Union transit procedure, to the Member State of Destination can be started, which might reduce delays and formalities. Note: in any case, the EU27 Member State of Destination will have to close in an exceptional way (e.g. interruption) the excise movement in EMCS that began in the UK before the withdrawal date
If excise goods moving to the UK are still in the EU27 territory on the withdrawal date, the excise movements will no longer have a valid consignee. The consignor would have to issue a change of destination to report that the goods would be
returned to the consignor, or
sent to a new consignee in EU27 authorised to receive the goods
or
exported; this of course would require the lodging of an export declaration  If excise goods moving to the UK from the EU27 have entered the UK but the excise movement ha
not been closed before the withdrawal date then the latter cannot be closed normally in EMCS, since there is no longer a valid consignee for an intra-EU movement
However, Member States should treat such movements as valid and to allow to close them manually based on alternate evidence of exit of the EU27 (see above).
xcise goods moving through the UK between two EU27 Member States (e.g. from Belgium to Ireland) on the withdrawal date will be subject to customs formalities, if and where applicable, but the excise movement can still be completed normally.15
he excise movementeAD or fallback document will be a sufficient proof of Union status to avoid payment of import duty in the EU27. Other customs formalities will be the same as for other goods
Note: as the UK will have acceded to the Convention on a Common Transit Procedure16 by the withdrawal date, this should facilitate crossing the land bridge by allowing EMCS to be used in parallel with NCTS17, which should reduce delays and formalities
15
Council Directive 2008/118/EC article 17(1) 16 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM%3Al11025 17 New Computerised Transit System
The table below summarises the possibilities for ongoing excise movements under duty suspension: Movement Goods location on withdrawal date in UK in EU27 From UK to EU27 Customs formalities; closure (e.g. interruption) of the EMCS movement by EU27 MS of Destination + possible new e-AD from place of importation Consider excise movement as valid and to be closed normally From EU27 to UK alternate evidence of exit (evidence that goods are in the UK) to close the movement at EU27 MS of Dispatch Change of destination Through UK Customs formalities to enter EU27 MS of Destination and eAD/FAD is proof of Union status in MS of Destination: normal completion in other EU27 MS: Customs formalities to go through UK if applicable and eAD/FAD is proof of Union status
2.3. Excise goods already released for consumption (Duty Paid) Business-to-Business For intra-EU business-to-business movement of excise goods already released for consumption to or from the UK started before but still ongoing on or after the withdrawal date
EU excise procedures no longer apply; in particular, SAAD paper documents are no longer mutually recognised between EU27 and the UK;  If excise goods from the UK are in the territory of the EU27 on the withdrawal date, Member States should treat such movements as valid and to allow the consignee to close them
Where the consignee of a duty paid business-to-business movement can prove that the goods entered the territory of the EU27 before the withdrawal date but has not submitted the SAAD to the Member State of destination before this date to close the movement, the competent authority of the EU27 Member State of Destination should accept the SAAD.  If excise goods from the UK are still in the UK on the withdrawal date then they will be subject to import formalities on arrival in the EU27, including payment of excise duty at the border, unless the goods are placed under excise duty suspension within the EU27. A new excise movement would then have to be started from the Member State of importation to the Member State of Destination; alternatively an
external transit movement, as provided under the Union transit procedure, to the Member State of Destination can be started, which might reduce delays and formalities.  If excise goods moving to the UK are in the territory of the EU27, other than the Member State of dispatch on the withdrawal date, Member States should apply the same approach to such movements as they apply to the exceptional export of goods released for consumption to other third countries. In particular, where goods under cover of an SAAD cross the territory of a Member State other than the Member State of dispatch, that Member State is recommended to continue to accept the SAAD as a proof of a valid excise movement and not to charge excise duty if export formalities are fulfilled and where the goods exit for the UK. This requires an export declaration to be lodged. The Commission also recommends that the Member State of dispatch refunds or remits the already paid excise duty if the consignor provides a proof of exit.
The goods can also be returned to the location of Dispatch under cover of the SAAD
If excise goods moving to the UK are in the territory of the UK on the withdrawal date then proof of the end of the movement and payment of duty in the UK would have to be obtained that met the needs of the MS of Dispatch. There is no legal obligation for a Member State to refund excise duty in the case of exported duty paid goods. However, if the certified copy 3 of the SAAD was issued by the UK18 before the withdrawal date this should be treated as a normal excise movement and requests for refund of excise duty in the Member State of dispatch should be treated normally. Other refunds would be at the discretion of the MS of Dispatch.
xcise goods moving through the UK between two EU27 Member States (e.g. from Belgium to Ireland) may be subject to Customs formalities, although import duty should not be charged, since the SAAD is a valid proof of Union status.
Note: as the UK will have acceded the Convention on a Common Transit Procedure by the withdrawal date, this should facilitate crossing the land bridge by allowing the use of NCTS19, which should reduce delays and formalities
Note: Refunds of excise duty may not be available due to lack of legally acceptable evidence and the absence of a common legal base for refunds of excise duty on the export of duty paid goods. Any remission or reimbursement of excise duty in these circumstances is a national matter.
18 Or other document issued by the UK and accepted by the Member State of Dispatch, certifying that the goods have been delivered and the chargeable excise duty has been paid in the UK 19 New Computerised Transit System
Business-to-Consumer (Distance Selling) The same principles as business-to-business apply mutatis mutandis to distance selling procedures for intra-EU cross-border distance sales of excise goods to or from the UK started before but still ongoing on or after the withdrawal date. No distance sales of excise goods from or to the UK may start as of the withdrawal date. 2.4. EMCS ARC Follow Up The "EMCS ARC Follow Up20" feature on the europa.eu website (to enter production in February 2019) will remain available for EMCS movements to/from the UK that started before the withdrawal date. However, as described above, no new information exchange to/from the UK can be received via trans-European IT systems for the movements that were not completed before the withdrawal date. Consequently, the status of such movements will not be updated in "EMCS ARC Follow Up" as of the withdrawal date
For instance, if an ongoing movement to the UK is closed manually after the withdrawal date by the EU27 Member State of Dispatch then the manual closure will be visible only in the National Excise Application of this Member State and not in the common domain of EMCS. Therefore, the manual closure and the related status update of the movement will not be visible in EMCS ARC Follow Up. Member States are recommended to inform economic operators of this limitation and the unreliability of this information around the period of the withdrawal of the UK
3.
XCISE DEBT
EXEMPTIONS AND GUARANTEE As of the withdrawal date
no guarantee will be automatically mutually recognised between the UK and EU27 Member States;  no exemption will be automatically mutually recognised between the UK and EU27 Member States;  no excise debts will be managed between the UK and EU27 Member States; and  there will be no legal basis for calling upon guarantees held by UK consignors and/or consignees.                                                  20 EMCS ARC Follow Up is a feature that allows a user to enter an Administrative Reference Code and get limited information on the related EMCS movement (e.g. status, MS of Dispatch, MS of destination, list of main messages exchanged); it is a publicly available feature that requires neither identification nor authentication.
4.
CONOMIC OPERATORS REGISTRATION AND AUTHORISATION 4.1. Overview This section applies only to the Economic Operators registered in SEED, i.e. authorised to perform intra-EU cross-border movements of excise goods under duty suspension. 4.2. Expiration of UK registrations and authorisations As of the withdrawal date, the registration of Economic Operators established in the UK and their authorisation will be invalid. Consequently
they will not be able to send or receive new e-ADs (see also section
). Member States are also recommended to check that e-ADs have not been accepted before Brexit, but with a dispatch date recorded in the future after the withdrawal date.21 Member States should request that economic operators do not submit e-ADs with dispatch dates to after the withdrawal date.   No creation, update or new invalidations of registrations and authorisations of Economic Operators established in the UK will be possible after the withdrawal date
The records of such Economic Operators and authorisations will be kept in SEED for 4 years so that ongoing movements can be closed manually and EU27 Member States' auditors and other staff can access UK Economic Operators data. 4.3. "Orphan" EU27 Tax Warehouses As illustrated in the schema hereafter, it may happen that Tax Warehouses in the territory of EU27 are related only to Tax Warehouse Keepers established in the UK. In this case, such Tax Warehouses will be left "orphan" (i.e. with no authorised warehouse keepers established in EU2722) after the withdrawal date. This implies that such Tax Warehouses will actually not be able to operate intra-EU27 cross-border movements of excise goods under duty suspension.  Member States Administrations and Economic Operators are advised to take all necessary measures before the withdrawal date in order to avoid such situations. A measure can be to assign a valid warehouse keeper established in a EU27 Member State
21
An e-AD can be submitted up to 7 days before the planned date of dispatch
22 After the withdrawal date, the record of the UK tax warehouse keepers will still be present in SEED but their authorisation will be invalid. 10 Before withdrawal date After withdrawal date

EU27 warehouse UK authorised keepers only EU27 warehouse No EU27 authorised keeper
4.4. Access of the UK to SEED As of the withdrawal date, no SEED data will be shared with the UK. In particular:  SEED data will not been synchronised any longer with UK national IT systems
the officials of the UK administration will have no access to SEED on WEB (SEED's human user interface, which allows reading and modifying SEED data). This implies that as of the withdrawal date, EU27's and the UK's view of each other's Economic Operators data will be the "snapshot" at the time of the withdrawal date, when the latest data synchronisation will have occurred. 5.
EFERENCE DATA 5.1. Customs Office List and Excise Role As of the withdrawal date all excise roles will be removed from all UK customs offices in the Customs Office List. 5.2. Code Lists As of the withdrawal date, excise IT systems' code lists will not be shared with the UK. 6.
TATISTICS As of the withdrawal date, the officials of the UK administration will have no access to excise trans-European IT systems' operational statistics provided by the central IT component CS/MISE, neither via its user interface nor via consolidated reports. 7.
VAILABILITY MANAGEMENT As of the withdrawal date, no excise IT system's unavailability will be shared between the UK and EU27. 11 8.
DMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION As of withdrawal date, the Administrative Cooperation Regulation23 and the Naples II Convention, no longer apply to the UK. All pending administrative cooperation procedures on the withdrawal date on the basis of EU law between the EU27 Member States and the UK will be discontinued on the withdrawal date.
As of the withdrawal date, n
information exchange will be possible between the UK and EU27 Member States via excise trans-European IT systems such as EMCS or CCN Mail
It will no longer be possible to make new administrative cooperation requests or to receive or to send replies to open administrative cooperation requests.  However, mutual assistance requests concerning excise issues may be possible between certain Member States and the UK using the OECD-Council of Europe Convention of 25.1.1988 on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters.24

ANNEX

ECOMMENDED ALTERNATE EVIDENCE OF EXIT A document in which the competent authority of the UK certify the delivery25 or the entry into the UK territory in accordance with the rules and procedures applicable to that certification may be considered an appropriate alternate evidence of exit by EU27 Member States
Moreover, EU27 Member States may also take into account anyone of the following pieces of evidence or a combination of them:  (i) a delivery note;  (ii) a document signed or authenticated by the economic operator who has taken the excise goods out of the customs territory of the Union certifying the exit of the goods;  (iii) a document in which the customs authority of a Member State or a third country certify the delivery in accordance with the rules and procedures applicable to that certification in that State or country; (iv) records of goods supplied to ships, aircraft or offshore installations kept by economic operators; (v) other alternative pieces of evidence acceptable to the authorities of the  Member State of dispatch.
Competent authorities in each EU27 Member State perform their own assessment of the validity of such evidence.
25 Even though fallback documents are no longer automatically mutually recognised between the UK and EU27, a fallback report of receipt certified by a UK competent authority may be considered an appropriate evidence of delivery by the competent authority of a EU27 Member State.

OTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF DUAL USE EXPORT CONTROLS The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that as from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET)
the United Kingdom will be a third country
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties.  In view of the uncertainties surrounding the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, all interested parties, and especially economic operators, are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country
Subject to the transition period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement,
as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules on dual-use export controls, and in particular, Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual
use items
(the "Regulation") will no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences:
1.
UAL-USE EXPORTS TO THE UNITED KINGDOM
The Regulation provides for the control of the export, brokering and transit of dual-use items. As of the withdrawal date, controls under the Regulation will appl
in relation to the United Kingdom as third country.

n accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.

s of the withdrawal date, export licences issued by the United Kingdom as an EU Member State under the Regulation are no longer valid for exports of dual-use items from the EU-27 to third countries.
Rather, such exports of dual-use items from the EU-27 to third countries are going to require
as of the withdrawal date, a licence issued by a competent authority of one of the EU-27 Member States, in accordance with Article 9 of the Regulation. 3.
NTRA-EU TRANSFER LICENCES TO THE UNITED KINGDOM ISSUED BEFORE THE WITHDRAWAL DATE According to Article 22 of the Regulation, certain very sensitive dual-use items, listed in Annex IV to the Regulation, are subject to intra-EU transfer controls. As of the withdrawal date, the export of these items will be subject to authorisation under the terms and conditions of the Regulation.  However, intra-EU transfer licences issued by one of the EU27 Member State
for transfers to the United Kingdom issued before the withdrawal date should be
onsidered as valid licence
for exports to the United Kingdom as of the withdrawal date
and until the validity of the licence expires. The website of the Commission (http://ec.europa.eu/trade/import-and-export-rules/export-from-eu/dual-use-controls/) provide

USTOMS DEBT
GENERAL Depending on the customs procedure chosen15, a customs debt on import is incurred through the placing under one of the customs procedures of non-Union goods liable to import duty. In particular, according to Article 77 UCC, a customs debt on import shall be incurred through the placing of non-Union goods liable to import duty under the customs procedure of release for free circulation in the Union. The customs debt is defined by Article 5(18) UCC as the obligation on a person to pay the amount of import or export duty which applies to specific goods under the customs legislation in force. The amount of import duty resulting from a customs debt is calculated on the basis of four main elements:   The customs value of the goods, in case of ad valorem import duty, or specific quantities, in case of specific import duty, serving as taxable amount;  The tariff classification of the goods in the Combined Nomenclature laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87
The non-preferential origin of the goods, for the application of non-preferential tariff measures (e.g. a GATT tariff quota or an anti-dumping duty); and/or the preferential origin of the goods, for the application of preferential tariff measures contained in agreements, concluded by the Union with certain third countries or territories (Free Trade Agreements), or adopted unilaterally by the Union in respect of certain third countries or territories (e.g. the Generalised Scheme of Preferences
GSP); and  The rates of import duty to apply to the taxable amount (customs value or quantity), which depend on the tariff classification of the goods and their origin. 2.
USTOMS VALUE OF THE GOODS According to Article 70 UCC16 the primary basis for the customs value of a good is its transaction value, which is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the customs territory of the Union, adjusted where necessary

See the "notices to stakeholders" published here: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/customs_and_indirect_taxation_en.pdf. For issue
arising around the withdrawal date in case of no deal, please refer to the guidance note on Customs matters

as well the guidance note on Excise for ongoing movements of goods
https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/guidance-excise-ongoing-movements-goods_en). 16
The full list of the legal references to customs value can be found in the compendium on customs value: https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/customs_valuation_compendium_2018_en.pdf
4 To determine the customs value of the good, that price shall be supplemented
where not already included in the transaction value
by a number of adjustments, which include, inter alia, the following:  Commissions and brokerage, except buying commissions
Costs of containers and packing;  The value of certain goods and services supplied by the buyer in connection with the production and sale for export of the imported goods, free of
Royalties and licence fees related to the goods that the buyer must pay as a condition of sale of the goods;  The costs of transport and insurance and the loading and handling charges associated with the transport of the good, up to the place where it is brought into the customs territory of the EU.17 On the other hand, a number of elements do not need to be included in the customs value like, inter alia, the cost of transport or various charges incurred on the goods after their entry into the customs territory of the Union, charges for interest under certain financing arrangements, charges for the right to reproduce the goods, buying commissions, import duties or other charges payable on import. For details, please refer to the guidance on customs valuation: https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/resources/documents/customs/customs_code/guidance_valuation_en.pdf 3.
USTOMS TARIFF Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff18 sets out the applicable tariffs for non-Union goods. These are also published and constantly updated in the multilingual database TARIC.19 To establish the third country duty rate goods have to be classified (Article 57 UCC) in the Combined Nomenclature (CN) to determine the CN headings and subheadings. For example:
otor cars and other motor vehicles principally designed for the transport of persons, with a cylinder capacity not exceeding 1500cm3: CN code                                                  17
In this context, the Commission is planning to adopt an amendment to the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447 of 24 November 2015 laying down detailed rules for implementing certain provisions of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Union Customs Code

Frozen carcasses and half-carcasses of high-quality beef and veal: CN code 0202 10 00  third country duty rate is 12.80% of the customs value of the goods + 176.80 EUR/100kg
4.
RIGIN OF THE GOOD In case of no-deal as from the withdrawal date imports from the UK will be treated as imports from any third country with which the EU does not have any preferential arrangement. Therefore, only of relevance are the EU non-preferential rules of origin. The basic rules on the non-preferential origin of goods are laid down in Articles 59 to 63 UCC. Article 59 UCC establishes the scope of the rules for the determination of the non-preferential origin of goods for the purposes of the application of non-preferential tariff measures (e.g. GATT tariff quotas or anti-dumping duties), of measures related to trade in goods other than tariff measures (e.g. certain prohibitions) and of other Union measures relating to the origin of goods (e.g. external trade statistics).
ccording to Article 60 UCC, goods wholly obtained in a country shall be regarded as having their origin in that country. Where the production of goods involves more than one country, the country of origin is deemed to be the country or territory where the good underwent its last, substantial, economically justified processing or working, in an undertaking equipped for that purpose, resulting in the manufacture of a new product or representing an important stage of manufacture
For details, please refer to the information on rules of origin here: https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/calculation-customs-duties/rules-origin_en

1.
NTRODUCTION The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. Following
request by the United Kingdom, the European Council (Article 50) agreed on 11 April 2019
to extend further
the period provided for in Article 50(3) TEU until 31 October 2019.
This means that the United Kingdom will be, as of 1 a third country

Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national administrations but also for private parties. In view of the uncertainties surrounding the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement
persons who plan to travel (for private or business reasons) from the United Kingdom to the EU (and vice-versa) on the withdrawal date or thereafter, and businesses providing services in relation to such travel (travel organisers, travel agencies, car rental companies, trade fairs
transport companies, etc.) are reminded of the legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becom
a third country
Subject to the transition period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement,
as of the withdrawal date, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom has the following consequences for travellers from the United Kingdom to the EU and vice-versa:

European Council Decision (EU) 2019/584, OJ L 101, 11.4.2019, p. 1.
Following a request by the United Kingdom, the European Council had decided a first extension on 22 March 2019 (European Council Decision (EU) 2019/476, OJ L 80I, 22.3.2019, p. 1).
On 11 April 2019, following a second request for an extension by the United Kingdom, the European Council also decided that the decision to extend until 31 October 2019 would cease to apply on 31 May 2019 if the United Kingdom had not held elections to the European Parliament and had not ratified the Withdrawal Agreement by 22 May 2019. As the United Kingdom had not ratified the Withdrawal Agreement by 22 May 2019, it held European elections on 23 May 2019.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
In addition, if the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified by both parties before that date, the withdrawal takes place on the first day of the month following the completion of the ratification procedures.

It is recalled that, in order for the transition period to apply, the Withdrawal Agreement has to be ratified by the EU and the United Kingdom

It is recalled that the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom would provide for specific solutions addressing the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland.

ORDER CHECKS ON PERSONS AT THE EU EXTERNAL BORDER,10 11 AIRPORT TRANSIT VISA 2.1. Entry and exit checks Union law12 on border checks at the EU external borders on persons distinguishes between controls of EU citizens and of third country nationals. As of the withdrawal date, controls of UK nationals upon entry to and exit from the Schengen area as well as to and from Member States for which the decision on lifting internal controls has not been taken yet but which apply Schengen rules at their external borders13 will follow the rules for third country nationals.14 15 This means that they will no longer enjoy facilitations at the borders provided for EU citizens, nationals of the contracting states of the European Economic Area, and Swiss nationals ("EU/EEA/CH citizens") related to the free movement rights. In particular, UK nationals will not be entitled to use the separate lanes provided for EU/EEA/CH citizens to carry out checks at border crossings16 and will be subject to thorough checks of all entry conditions for third country nationals upon entry.
The entry checks on UK nationals will include verification of:17
the possession of a valid travel document for crossing the border; the document needs to have a validity of no more than ten years, and shall be still valid for three months after the intended departure from the Member States
Please note that UK national passports issued prior to the withdrawal date remain valid travel documents.                                                  10

This section does not apply for travels in the Common Travel Area between the United Kingdom and Ireland. 12
Article 8(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2016 on a Union Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code), OJ L 77, 23.3.2016, p. 1
13
Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia. 14
Please note that UK nationals who are members of the family of a Union citizen exercising his or her right to free movement are subject to the rules set out in Article 5 of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States
OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 77

It should be noted that parts of these controls do already apply today, to citizens from the United Kingdom, when traveling into or out of the Schengen area. 16

the duration of the stay:
for short stays in the Schengen area, UK nationals will be subject to limitations as regards the authorised duration of stay within the Schengen area (with a maximum of 90 days in a 180-day period)
- for long stays, they will in principle require a residence permit or long stay visa issued by national authorities, under the national rules
- relevant databases with a view to verify:18
the identity and the nationality of the third-country national and of the authenticity and validity of the travel document for crossing the border, and in particular


if an alert has been issued in the Schengen Information System (SIS) for the purposes of refusing entry and to check possible threats to public policy, internal security, public health and international relations;
the purpose (e.g. tourism or work) and the conditions of the intended stay (e.g. accommodation, internal travels)

the existence of sufficient means of subsistence (i.e. having sufficient means to pay for the intended stay and return travel). The EU has exempted, as part of its Brexit contingency actions, UK nationals from the requirement to be in possession of a short-ngen-19 when crossing the external borders, where the intended duration of the stay in the Schengen area is 90 days within a 180-day period.20 A continued exemption from Schengen visa will require that nationals of all EU Member States are equally exempted from UK short-stay visa requirements, following the visa reciprocity principle.                                                  18
Please note that the possibility of a temporary derogation from the principle, subject to some conditions, of the systematic checks against relevant databases at some land and sea border crossing points does not apply to third country nationals (Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/399). 19
Article 6(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/399. 20
Regulation (EU) 2019/592 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 April 2019 amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1806 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement, as regards the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union, OJ L 103I , 12.4.2019, p. 1

Travellers are advised to verify, prior to travel, the validity of travel documents and to ensure that they fulfil all the above conditions before they travel to the EU
The non-fulfilment of any of the entry conditions may result21 in refusal of entry issued in line with the procedure set out in Union law with regard to third country nationals.22 Checks on exit include verification of:
the possession of a valid travel document for crossing the external border
- verification that the person did not exceed the maximum duration of stay in the territory of the Member States
- relevant databases similarly as upon entry checks
Travellers are advised to take account of possible delays at border posts as of the withdrawal date, especially at those with heavy volumes of traffic (Eurostar train stations, Eurotunnel Le Shuttle in Calais and Folkestone, Channel ports, etc). 2.2. Airport transit visa23 Union law on visas24 requires certain third country nationals25 to hold an Airport Transit Visa when passing through the international transit areas of airports situated in the EU (with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom) and the Schengen Associated Countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein26, Norway and Switzerland) without entering the territory of these countries. For example, this applies to a journey between two non-EU/non-Schengen destinations with a change of plane at an airport located in the EU (except Ireland and the United Kingdom) or in the Schengen Associated Countries
The requirement for an Airport Transit Visa applies to these third country nationals passing through the international transit areas of airport
located in the EU (except Ireland) or in the Schengen Associated Countries when travelling from a third country to the United Kingdom and vice-versa. The Visa Code sets out some exceptions to this requirement, for example for third                                                  21
Regulation (EU) 2016/399 provides for some limited exceptions, where despite the non-fulfilment of entry conditions the third country national can be granted entry. 22

As of the withdrawal date, a valid residence permit or visa issued by the United Kingdom does not exempt thes
third country national
from the requirement to hold an Airport Transit Visa. Nationals concerned who pass through international transit areas of airport
situated in the EU27 Member States (with the exception of Ireland) and the Schengen Associated Countries (Iceland, Norway and Switzerland
when travelling between the United Kingdom and another third country as of the withdrawal date are advised to apply for an Airport Transit Visa and to take the necessary steps sufficiently in advance of their travel. 3.
USTOMS CONTROLS As of the withdrawal date, goods which are brought into the customs territory of the EU from the United Kingdom are subject to customs supervision and may be subject to customs controls in accordance with EU customs law.27 28 Luggage and other goods carried by or on travellers entering the EU from the United Kingdom will be subject to customs controls.29 Allowances are made for rtain other items (see section 4.1 below). In particular, goods which are intended to be put on the EU market or intended for private use or consumption within the customs territory of the EU must be declared for release for free circulation.

The goods concerned and the corresponding allowances can be found at: https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/individuals/travelling/entering-eu_en Travellers are advised to familiarise themselves with the rules concerning duty free allowances and only go through the green customs exit ("green channel") if they have no more than the maximum quantities allowed. Otherwise they should use the red exit ("red channel") and make a customs declaration. 4.2. VAT refunds for goods purchased in the EU31 Visitors from outside the EU are entitled to get a refund of VAT paid on goods they have purchased during their stay in the EU provided that the goods are presented to customs on departure from the EU together with the VAT refund documents. Guide to VAT refund for visitors to the EU                                                  30
Regarding customs duties, the rules set out in this  section will apply, as of the withdrawal date, also to goods brought into the customs territory of the EU from the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands
Article 4(1) last indent of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code, OJ L 269, 10.10.2013, p. 1).  Regarding VAT, the rules set out in this section will apply, as of the withdrawal date, also to goods brought into the VAT territory of the EU from the Isle of Man and vice-versa (Article 7(2) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1) (The Channel Islands are, already today, not part of the EU VAT territory, Article 6(1)(e) of Directive 2006/112/EC)

In the context of the negotiations of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement, the EU is trying to agree solutions with the United Kingdom to ensure the refund of VAT in relation to transactions prior to the end of the transition period in situations where the refund request could not be submitted by the taxable person or forwarded by his residence State before the end of the transition period. See, in particular, the latest text of the draft withdrawal agreement agreed at negotiator's level, which is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_agreement_coloured.pdf and the "joint statement" from the negotiators of the EU and of the United Kingdom Government presented on 19 June 2018 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/brexit-negotiations/negotiating-documents-article-50-negotiations-united-kingdom_en).
10 5.
ROHIBITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS EU law prohibits and restricts the introduction or importation of certain goods into the EU on grounds of inter alia the protection of human, animal and plant health , the environment or the protection of national treasures. As of the withdrawal date, these prohibitions and restrictions will apply to goods which enter the EU from the United Kingdom or are leaving the EU to the United Kingdom.32 While most prohibitions and restrictions de jure or in practice are only relevant for professional traders,33 some are also relevant for individual travellers: 5.1. Accompanying pets34
Union law35 sets rules for the non-commercial movement of pet dogs, cats and ferrets (hereafter "pets")36 that accompany travellers coming from third countries.37 38                                                  32
In the context of the negotiations of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement, the EU is trying to agree solutions with the United Kingdom for movement
of goods that have started before and end after the end of the transition period ("sailing goods"). See, in particular, the latest text of the draft withdrawal agreement agreed at negotiator's level, which is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_agreement_coloured.pdf and the "joint statement" from the negotiators of the EU and of the United Kingdom Government presented on 19 June 2018 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/brexit-negotiations/negotiating-documents-article-50-negotiations-united-kingdom_en).

Please note that, currently, live pet birds accompanying travellers entering the EU have to be accompanied by a veterinary certificate certifying compliance with one of the following requirements: a 30-days isolation prior to departure in the third country, or a 10-day isolation period with testing for avian influenza, or a post import quarantine in the Member State of destination or vaccination against avian influenza. (Commission Decision 2007/25/EC of 22 December 2006 as regards certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza and movements of pet birds accompanying their owners into the Community (OJ L 8, 13.1.2007, p. 29)).
In addition, regarding live pet birds, requirements for introducing specimens of endangered species may apply (see below, section 5.6
37
In the context of the negotiations of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement, the EU is trying to agree solutions with the United Kingdom for live animals the movement of which is ongoing at the end of the transition period. See, in particular, the latest text of the draft withdrawal agreement agreed at negotiator's level, which is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_agreement_coloured.pdf and the "joint statement" from the negotiators of the EU and of the United Kingdom Government presented on 19 June 2018 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/brexit-negotiations/negotiating-documents-article-50-negotiations-united-kingdom_en).
11 5.1.1. Non-commercial movements into the EU-27 of pets accompanying a pet owner resident in the United Kingdom
he "EU pet passport"39 issued before the withdrawal date to a pet owner resident in the United Kingdom will from that date no longer be a valid document for travelling with pets from the United Kingdom to any of the EU-27 Member States as of the withdrawal date.  The requirements for pets accompanying travellers coming from the United Kingdom as of the withdrawal date will also depend on whether the United Kingdom is "listed", as of that date, as a third country providing certain animal health guarantees. Travellers concerned are advised to enquire, sufficiently in advance of a planned trip from the United Kingdom to the EU, whether the United Kingdom is "listed" in order to establish what requirements apply. The lists adopted by the EU are published here: https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/pet-movement/eu-legislation/non-commercial-non-eu/listing_en.  5.1.1.1. If the United Kingdom is listed by the Commission in accordance with Article 13(1) of Regulation (EU) No 576/201340
Pets moved into the EU-27 as of the withdrawal date will have to be accompanied by a duly filled-in third country pet passport, the model of which has been adopted by the Commission.41 This passport must attest a valid anti

-vis the United Kingdom. Customs authorities are empowered under Regulation (EC) No 1889/2005 to undertake controls on individuals, their baggage and their means of transport and detain cash that has not been declared. Travellers must be aware that all Member States of the EU apply penalties in the event of failure to comply with the obligation to declare as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1889/2005

17 plants)79 into the EU only subject to the prior authorisation by the CITES authority of the Member State of destination. The persons travelling from the EU to a third country may (re-)export such specimens only based on the prior authorisation by the CITES authority of the Member State where the specimens are located. The documents required to this effect depend on the status of the species in question (i.e. how strictly it is protected, which varies between the different annexes to
egulation (EC) No 338/97) and on the nature and direction of the movement (import, export or re-export). Union law provides, however, for exceptions from the authorisation requirement:  "Personal and household effects": The import or (re-)export of 'personal and household effects' is not subject to prior authorisation.80 81 However, certain conditions regarding the mode and circumstances of the cross-border movement must be fulfilled for dead specimens and parts or derivatives of animals or plants to be considered as 'personal and household effects'. Live animals or plants do not qualify as such. Hunting trophies are generally also covered by these less strict provisions, but hunting trophies from certain strictly protected species are subject to specific rules.82  Pets: People travelling to and from the EU with their pets, where these belong to species listed in the annexes to Regulation (EC) No 338/97 (such as most parrots83, and certain turtles and corals) can apply for a personal ownership certificate.84 Such a certificate can be obtained for a legally acquired live animal held for personal, non-commercial purposes, if the person travelling wants to avoid having to apply for prior authorisation each time an international border is crossed. For travels to and from the EU, the certificate is issued by the CITES authority of the Member State from which the animal originates or, if it originates from a third country, by the CITES authority of the Member State into which it was first introduced

personal ownership certificate issued by the CITES authority of the United Kingdom can, as of the withdrawal date no longer be used for travelling to or from the EU with a live animal. Rather, only certificates issued as of the withdrawal date by the United Kingdom as party to the CITES convention85 will be accepted as of the withdrawal date. Travellers concerned are advise
to contact the CITES authorities86 of the Member State of destination (if it is an import) or where the specimen is located (if it is a (re-)export) in order to apply and obtain the necessary prior authorisations or certificates. 5.7. Invasive alien species87 Union law88 provides that persons travelling to the EU may introduce specimens of invasive alien species of Union concern89 only subject to the prior authorisation by the competent authorities of the Member State of destination and, where relevant, of transit. The prohibition applies to live specimens as well as to any parts, gametes, seeds, eggs or propagules, hybrids, varieties or breeds of these species that might survive and subsequently reproduce. The list of invasive alien species of Union concern is valid throughout the EU territory, excluding the outermost regions, which must establish lists adapted to their own circumstances. However, in addition to the EU list of invasive alien species of Union concern, each Member State may establish its own national list of invasive alien species subject to specific national rules.  As of the withdrawal date, the rules indicated above will become applicable to movements of such specimens from the United Kingdom to the EU.  Travellers concerned are advised to seek advice on such national lists from the competent authorities of the destination or transit Member States.                                                  85

19 5.8. Firearms90
Union law91 provides for a specific regime for the movement of firearms between Member States, including firearms accompanying travellers. These rules provide, inter alia, for the issuing of a 'European firearms pass'. This is issued on request by the competent authorities of a Member State to a person who is lawfully entering into possession of and using a firearm.92 Whenever persons want to travel from an EU Member States to another EU Member State, or through an EU Member State, they must obtain prior authorisation from each of those Member States which will then be recorded in the European firearms pass that they must have in their possession throughout their journey. However, there are exceptions to this need for prior authorisation. This is the case for historical re-enactors and hunters, who may travel with specific categories of firearms as long as they are in possession of a European firearms pass listing their firearms and given that they are able to substantiate the reasons for their journey (such as an invitation for an event in Member State of destination). As of the withdrawal date, these rules no longer apply to firearms moved from the United Kingdom to the EU and vice-versa. Rather, rules for bringing firearms into/out of the Union will apply.93 These rules provide for the following:94  Where firearms are brought temporarily into the EU from the United Kingdom, national rules for the declaration and authorisation of firearms will apply.95
With respect to temporary exports from the EU to the United Kingdom of certain firearms by hunters or sport shooters as part of their accompanied personal effects (or for the re-export following temporary admission for hunting or sport shooting activities), no export authorisation will be required, provided that they substantiate to the competent authorities the reasons for the journey.96 When leaving the EU to the United Kingdom                                                  90

It is recalled that the United Kingdom is going to apply, as of the withdrawal date, national rules for imports and exports into/from the United Kingdom. 95

In the case of travel by air, the European Firearms Pass shall be produced to the competent authorities where the relevant items are handed over to the airline for transport out of the customs territory of the Union. When leaving the EU to the United Kingdom through the Member State of their residence, hunters and sport shooters may, instead of a European Firearms Pass, choose to produce another document considered valid for this purpose by the competent authorities of that Member State.97 Travellers concerned are advised to enquire with the responsible authorities of the United Kingdom or the relevant EU Member State what the precise conditions for the import, export or transit of firearms are. 6.
SE OF AUTOMOTIVE VEHICLES 6.1. Driving licences98
According to Union law,99 driving licences issued by Member States of the EU are mutually recognised.100 As of the withdrawal date, this mutual recognition will no longer be compulsory as a matter of EU law. Instead, an international agreement, the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic,101 will apply. The United Kingdom and all but four Member States (Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and Spain) are parties to this Convention which provides for the recognition of national driving licences and international driving permits issued by contracting states in accordance with this Convention. The four EU Member States (Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and Spain) which are not parties to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic are parties to a previous                                                                                                                                                  of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UN Firearms Protocol), and establishing export authorisation, and import and transit measures for firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, OJ L 94, 30.3.2012, p. 1

The holder of a valid driving licence issued by an EU Member State may also exchange it for an equivalent driving licence by another Member State if the holder takes up normal residence in that Member State (Articles 11 and 12 of Directive 2006/126/EC). As of the withdrawal date, a driving licence issued by the United Kingdom can no longer be exchanged for a driving licence by an EU-27 Member State on the basis of EU law. A driving licence issued, prior to the withdrawal date, by an EU-27 Member State in exchange of a driving licence issued in the United Kingdom remains valid. 101
Article 41(2) of the Convention on Road Traffic, Vienna, 8 November 1968.
21 international agreement, to which the United Kingdom is also a party 102.This agreement provides for the recognition of driving licences, but parties to this agreement may also require the holders of driving licences to be in possession of an International Driving Permit.  Holders of UK driving licences who intend to drive in the EU are therefore advised to contact the responsible Member State authorities regarding the recognition rules for driving licences. Holders of European Union driving licences who intend to drive in the United Kingdom are advised to contact the responsible authority in the United Kingdom regarding the recognition rules for their driving licences. 6.2. Third party liability insurance103
Union law104 prohibits the use on the territory of the EU Member States of uninsured vehicles, and ensures that insurance against civil liability arising from the use of vehicles covers the entire territory of the EU.105 A vehicle normally based in a third country must be provided with a valid "green card" or with a certificate of frontier insurance.106 Compliance with this requirement may be verified upon entry into the EU. As of the withdrawal date, for vehicles used in the EU but registered in the United Kingdom, only the international Green Card system107 applies. The Green Card system allows the use in a State of a vehicle insured in another State, provided that both States are members of the Green Card system. All EU-27 Member States and the United Kingdom participate in the Green Card system. However, the following should be noted:  The Green Card system does not oblige motor insurers in a Green Card member country to cover the territory of the Green Card member countries (an additional premium might be charged for the coverage).
ravellers to the EU from the United Kingdom with a UK-registered vehicle are advised to ensure, prior to travelling that their motor insurance policy covers the EU. The same applies for travellers from the EU to the United Kingdom with an EU-registered vehicle.                                                  102

Travellers to the EU from the United Kingdom with a UK-registered vehicle are advised to ensure, prior to travelling, that a Green Card is present in the vehicle, unless they have certainty that the aforementioned Commission decision has been taken. Travellers from the EU to the United Kingdom with an EU-registered vehicle are advised to travel with the Green Card in the vehicle, or query the matter with the authorities in the United Kingdom. 7.
EDICAL TREATMENT AND RELATED ISSUES
EMERGENCIES 7.1. Entitlement of healthcare under Union law on social security coordination109 Union law110 provides for access to healthcare during temporary stay abroad based on the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or, for planned treatments, based on the prior authorisation by the relevant competent institution (e.g. the institution with which the person concerned is insured). Costs of such healthcare are reimbursed between the relevant institutions of the Member States involved.  As of the withdrawal date, these rules no longer apply vis
-vis the United Kingdom.111 This means the following:  As of the withdrawal date, nationals of EU-27 Member States and their family members will not be able to access healthcare for unexpected care in the United Kingdom on the basis of EHIC. UK nationals will not be able to access healthcare in the EU-27 on the basis of EHIC as of the withdrawal date. Persons insured in an EU-27 Member State and intending to travel in the United Kingdom are advised to query with the institution with which they are insured whether it will reimburse healthcare accessed in a third country. The same applies to persons insured in the United Kingdom and intending to travel in the EU-27.                                                  108

111
In the context of the negotiations of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement, the EU is trying to agree solutions with the United Kingdom to ensure reimbursement, recovery and offsetting in relation to events that occurred before the end of the transition period. For information on the ongoing negotiations, see https://ec.europa.eu/commission/brexit-negotiations_en
23 Where reimbursement is not ensured, persons concerned should consider taking out private travel insurance.  As of the withdrawal date, prior authorisations for planned treatments in the United Kingdom can no longer be issued by EU-27 Member States on the basis of Union law. No prior authorisations can be issued by the United Kingdom for planned treatments in the EU-27 on the basis of Union law. 7.2. Entitlement of re-imbursement for cross-border healthcare under Union law on cross-border healthcare112
Apart from the system of social security coordination referred to in section 7.1 of this notice, Union law113 also provides for the possibility to obtain, under certain circumstances, reimbursement by the Member State of affiliation for a cross-border healthcare treatment in another Member State. As of the withdrawal date, patients affiliated in an EU-27 Member State will no longer benefit from the rules on reimbursement set out in that legislation as regards the cross-border treatment provided in the United Kingdom. Nor will patients affiliated in the United Kingdom any longer benefit from EU rules on reimbursement. It will be up to the EU-27 Member State of affiliation and the United Kingdom to decide on the reimbursement of such healthcare based on national law (in the same way as for healthcare received in other third countries).  Patients intending to obtain, as of the withdrawal date, reimbursement from an EU-27 Member State of affiliation for a treatment provided in the United Kingdom should query with their National Contact Points set up in accordance with Union law.114
The same applies to patients intending to obtain, as of the withdrawal date, reimbursement from the United Kingdom.115 7.3. Recognition of medical prescriptions issued in another Member State116 Union law117 obliges Member States to recognise cross-border medical prescriptions of medicinal products or medical devices issued in another                                                  112

European emergency number  112118 Union law119 obliges Member States to ensure that all end-users of electronic communications services allowing calls from fixed and mobile telephones, including from payphones, are able to call the "European emergency number" 112 free of charge
In addition, users with disabilities must have access to emergency services that is equivalent to that enjoyed by other users.

that EU Member States mutually recognise parking cards for people with disabilities, introduced in accordance with the standardised EU-model parking card.122 Under current practices, United Kingdom authorities123 usually recognise EU-model parking cards issued by other EU Member States, allowing owners of an EU-model parking card to park in parking spaces reserved for disabled persons in the United Kingdom. The same holds usually for the recognition, in an EU-27 Member State of a United Kingdom national parking card (the so-called "Blue Badge").124 There is no certainty that authorities in the EU and in United Kingdom will maintain the usual practice of mutual recognition of each other's parking cards                                                                                                                                                  117

25 for people with disabilities. This will be a matter for the discretion of these authorities. Persons with disabilities using a parking card for people with disabilities may therefore wish to contact the relevant authorities in advance. 7.6. Consular protection125 Union law126 entitles EU citizens to consular protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of any EU Member State, if they find themselves in a situation where they require assistance outside the EU with no embassy or consulate from their own Member State effectively in a position to help them
they are unrepresented). Unrepresented EU citizens are entitled to receive consular protection on the same conditions as the nationals of the EU Member State they turn to. As of the withdrawal date, UK nationals will no longer be able to benefit from this right and EU-27 citizens will no longer be able to turn to UK embassies and consulates to seek consular protection on the basis of EU law.  7.7. Compensation mechanism for persons injured by a car in another Member State ("visiting victims")127 Union law provides for a compensation mechanism for injured persons in an accident occurring in another Member State and caused by the use of a vehicle based in that Member State ("visiting victims").128 This mechanism provides for compensation of the victim by the "compensation body" of the Member State of residence of the victim if the insurer fails to communicate with the injured party within a given deadline.129
As of the withdrawal date, this mechanism no longer applies to persons residing in the United Kingdom and injured by a ca
while visiting an EU-27 Member State and vice-versa

NSURANCE
PASSENGER RIGHTS 8.1. Insolvency travel insurance Union law130 provides obligations for traders who organise package travel or facilitate linked travel arrangements, among others to protect travellers against insolvency.  Organisers and traders must comply with these obligations even when they are established in third countries131 as long as they sell or offer such services in an EU Member State or direct their activities to an EU Member State (by inter alia using a language or a currency other than the language or currency of the Member State of establishment).  In addition, when travellers buy packages from organisers established in a third country via retailers established in the EU, the performance of the package and the securities for the refunds of the unless the retailer provide
evidence that the organiser complies with these obligations.132
Hence, as of the withdrawal date, EU law obliging organisers to protect travellers against the insolvency of the organiser will cease to apply where the organiser established in the United Kingdom does not direct its selling activities to the EU, and the package travel is not bought through a retailer in the EU
In these cases, travellers are advised to assess the need to protect themselves against a possible insolvency of the organiser. 8.2. EU passenger rights133 Union law provides for a set of rights for passengers, not only for air, but also for ship, bus and coach and rail passengers. These rights relate to information, reimbursement and re-routing, compensation, assistance and care, right of redress, and special rights for persons with disabilities and with reduced mobility. As of the withdrawal date, EU passenger rights may no longer apply to travel between the EU and the United Kingdom, or may be limited.                                                  130

27 8.2.1. Air passenger rights As of the withdrawal date, EU air passenger rights134 will no longer apply to a flight with a non-EU carrier from an airport located in the United Kingdom to an airport located in the EU. The air passenger rights granted by EU law will however continue to apply to
(i) flights departing from the United Kingdom to an airport situated in the territory of an EU-27 Member State operated by a Community carrier; as well as (ii) flights departing from the EU-27 to a United Kingdom airport operated by any carrier.
Travellers should thus be aware that, depending on the carrier chosen, certain EU passenger rights will no longer apply to inbound flights to the EU. EU law granting specific rights for persons with disabilities and persons with reduced mobility135 travelling by air will no longer apply to air services that, as of the withdrawal date,  (i) depart from an airport in the United Kingdom,  (ii) transit through an airport in the United Kingdom, or  (iii) arrive at an airport in the United Kingdom.
However, certain rights, such as assistance by air carriers, continue to apply to air passengers departing from a United Kingdom airport to an EU-27 airport if the operating carrier is a Community air carrier. 8.2.2. Ship passengers rights EU ship passenger rights136 continue to apply where  (i) the port of embarkation is in the EU-27; or  (ii) the port of embarkation is in the United Kingdom, if the port of disembarkation is in the EU-27 and the service is operated by a carrier established within the territory of a Member State or offering                                                  134

Travellers should be aware that, depending on the carrier chosen, EU passenger rights may no longer apply to journeys to the EU. Regarding cruise passengers, the current set of EU passenger rights continues to apply if the port of embarkation is situated in a Member State. 8.2.3. Bus and coach passenger rights  EU bus and coach passenger rights137 continue to apply to passengers travelling with regular services138 where the boarding or the alighting point of the passengers is situated in the territory of a Member State and where the scheduled distance of the service is 250 km or more. For passengers where a scheduled distance of the service is less than 250 km, a reduced set of rules applies. Some Member States have exempted services from the application of the Regulation on passenger rights if a significant part of a regular service (including at least one scheduled stop) is operated outside the Union.139 The bus and coach passenger rights granted by EU law will therefore continue to apply  if no exemption applies
to
i) passengers departing from the United Kingdom to a destination situated in the territory of an EU-27 Member State; as well as
ii) passengers departing from the EU-27 to a United Kingdom destination. 8.2.4.

THER ISSUES 9.1. Card payments141 While the acceptance of debit or credit cards for payment transactions depends on the respective preferences of merchants, Union law142 sets limits to interchange fees charged to merchants in respect of such transactions. These rules only apply where both the payer's payment service provider and the payee's payment service provider are located in the EU.143 As of the withdrawal date, transactions between the EU-27 and the United Kingdom will no longer be covered by the EU rules limiting interchange fees.  Provided that merchants are allowed to apply surcharges on consumers for card payments
this may lead to a higher surcharge for card payments. 9.2. Roaming144 Union law145 on roaming services prohibit
any surcharge on roaming customers by the roaming provider (i.e. the domestic provider of mobile communications services
voice, SMS or data services) operating in an EU Member State in addition to the domestic retail price when travelling in the EU.  As of the withdrawal date, this obligation in Union law on the roaming provider will no longer apply either to roaming providers operating in the United Kingdom whenever their customers are roaming in the EU, or to roaming providers operating in the EU whenever their customers are roaming in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, roaming providers operating in a Member State will remain subject to the obligation in Union law to inform their customers about the roaming charges for the services provided applicable whenever they travel to the Unite
Kingdom.146

EUROPEAN COMMISSION DIRECTORATE-GENERAL CLIMATE ACTION
Brussels, 13 November 2018
OTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES FOR CO2 STANDARDS FOR NEW PASSENGER CARS AND NEW LIGHT COMMERCIAL VEHICLES
The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that, unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities, but also for private parties. In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, stakeholders are reminded of legal repercussions which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country.  Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU CO
standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles
will no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has in particular the following consequences: 1.
PECIFIC EMISSIONS TARGETS  Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 provides an obligation for manufacturers of new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles to meet specific CO
targets that are calculated annually
Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and the Council of 23 April 2009 setting emission performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the Community's integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles, OJ L 140 5.6.2009, p. 1; Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council of 11 May 2011 setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles as part of the Union's integrated approach to reduce CO 2 emissions from light-duty vehicles, OJ L 145, 31.5.2011, p. 1
2 taking into account the EU wide reduction targets set out in Article 1 of the respective Regulation (i.e. passenger cars: 130gCO2/km by 2015 and 95g CO2/km by 2021; light commercial vehicles: 175gCO2/km by 2017 and 147gCO2/km by 2020). It is for manufacturers to ensure that the average CO
emissions of their fleet of newly registered vehicles do not exceed their annual specific emissions target
As of the withdrawal date, new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles registered in the United Kingdom will no longer count towards the calculation of the average specific emissions of CO
in the EU. 2.
NNUAL TRANSMISSION OF CO
EMISSION DATA According to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, by 28 February each year, Member States must record and transmit to the Commission certain data on new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles registered in the Union in the preceding calendar year. That data will form the basis for determining the average specific emissions of CO
and the specific emissions target for each manufacturer and will also serve for assessing whether manufacturers comply with those targets.
Data for new registrations in 2018 transmitted by 28 February 2019 prior to the withdrawal date will be considered for determining the 2018 average specific emissions of CO
and the specific emissions target for that year for manufacturers of new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles. As of the withdrawal date, the United Kingdom is no longer required to record and transmit to the Commission data on registrations in the United Kingdom, i.e. in 2020 the United Kingdom is no longer obliged to transmit the data in relation to registrations in the calendar year 2019. 3.
EROGATIONS FROM THE SPECIFIC EMISSIONS TARGET According to Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, manufacturers may under certain conditions benefit from derogations from their specific emission targets
if they are responsible for fewer than 300 000 new registrations of passenger cars and fewer than 22 000 new registrations of light commercial vehicles in the EU per calendar year.
egistrations in the United Kingdom as of the withdrawal date do not count when assessing whether a manufacturer is eligible for such derogation
If the withdrawal of the United Kingdom affects the eligibility of a manufacturer for a derogation

Examples of services covered by the Directive on electronic commerce include online information services (such as online newspapers), online selling of products and services (books, financial services and travel services), online advertising, professional services (lawyers, doctors, estate agents), entertainment services and basic intermediary services (access to the Internet and transmission and hosting of information). These services include also services provided free of charge to the recipient and funded, for example, by advertising or sponsorship.

OTICE TO STAKEHOLDER
WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EU RULES IN THE FIELD OF  SECURITY OF NETWORK AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS The United Kingdom submitted on 29 March 2017 the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that
unless a ratified withdrawal agreement
establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').
The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'.
Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties. In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, stakeholders and particularly the  operators potentially subject to the obligations of Directive (EU) 2016/1148 on the security of network and information systems
are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country.  Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement,  as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of security of network and
Negotiations are ongoing with the United Kingdom with a view to reaching a withdrawal agreement.
Furthermore, in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, may unanimously decide that the Treaties cease to apply at a later date.
A third country is a country not member of the EU.
Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union
information systems no longer apply to the United Kingdom
This has in particular the following consequences on digital service providers
Article 16 of Directive (EU) 2016/1148 imposes on digital service providers some requirements on security and incident notification. In accordance with Article 17 of Directive (EU) 2016/1148, these requirements are subject to ex post supervisory control by the relevant national competent authorities as understood under Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2016/1148. Article 18 of Directive (EU) 2016/1148 provides for the rules on the jurisdiction for such supervisory activity:
here a digital service provider is established in the Union, it will be, pursuant to Article 18(1) of Directive (EU) 2016/1148, subject to the jurisdiction of the Member State where it has its main establishment, which in principle corresponds to the place where the provider has its head office in the Union

here a digital service provider
is no
established in the Union but offer
digital services into the Union, it must, in accordance with Article 18(2) of Directive (EU) 2016/1148
designate a representative in the Union
Pursuant to Article 4(10) of Directive (EU) 2016/1148, a representative means any natural or legal person established in the Union explicitly designated to act on behalf of a digital service provider not established in the Union with regard to the latter's obligations under this Directive. The designation of a representative by the digital service provider shall be without prejudice to legal actions which could be initiated against the digital service provider itself, as provided for under Article 18(3) of Directive (EU) 2016/1148
As of the withdrawal date, a digital service provider subject to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date because its main establishment in the EU was in the United Kingdom may be subject to the following:  If the digital service provider maintains one or several establishments in the EU27 Member States, it will be deemed to be under the jurisdiction of the EU27 Member State where it has its main establishment in the EU27, thus effectively resulting in a change of competent authority;  If the digital service provider is no longer established in the EU27 but offers digital services into the EU27, it will be subject to the obligation to designate a representative in an EU27 Member State in accordance with Article 18(2), as described above. Moreover, a digital service provider neither established in the EU27 nor in the United Kingdom but subject to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom before the withdrawal
Member States are required to transpose the Directive (EU) 2016/1148 by 9 May 2018
They are also required to identify, by 9 November 2018, the Operators of Essential Services active in the sectors of energy, transport, banking, financial market infrastructures, health, drinking water supply and distribution and digital infrastructure (cf. Article 5 for this obligation and Article 4(4) for a definition of Operators of Essential Services
6
Directive (EU) 2016/1148 defines 'digital service provider' as any legal person that provides a digital service (cf. Article 4(6))
The digital services covered by the Directive are online marketplace, online search engine and cloud computing services (cf. Article 4(5) and Annex III of Directive (EU) 2016/1148).

3 date because it had designated a representative in the United Kingdom in accordance with Article 18(2) will, as of the withdrawal date, be subject to the obligation to designate a representative in an EU27 Member State where services are offered by that digital service provider in accordance with Article 18(2). Consequently, the national competent authority, as understood under Article
of Directive (EU) 2016/1148, of that Member State where the digital service provider concerned has either its main establishment or has designated a representative, will receive notifications of incidents taking place within the Union and will exercise ex post supervisory control.  The website of the Commission on cyber-security (https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/cybersecurity) provide
general information concerning Directive (EU) 2016/1148. These pages will be updated with further information, where necessary.

This has in particular the following consequences in the different area
of electronic communications: 1.
ENERAL AUTHORISATION Providers established in at least one EU Member State enjoy the right to provide electronic communications networks and services in all other Member States without being required to have an establishment there. They can start providing networks and services without any formal licensing process and are subject only to a
general authorisation
in each Member State where they provide networks or services (Article 3 of the Authorisation Directive). The general authorisation comprises rights and obligations for the provision of electronic communications networks and services and Member State
may only request a simple notification
without any standstill obligation (Article 4 of the Authorisation Directive)
As of the withdrawal date, providers of electronic communications networks and/or services established in the United Kingdom will cease to benefit from the general authorisation regime within the EU-27 Member States
Hence
EU-27 Member State
may impose additional authorisation requirements on providers established in the United Kingdom. Furthermore
providers established in the United Kingdom will cease to have the right to request providers authorised in the EU-27 Member States which are not 'major suppliers' (within the meaning of the GATS Reference Paper on                                                                                                                                                  2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37

Moreover, they will not have the right to request or be subject to the dispute resolution procedure within the EU, neither for disputes within a Member State nor for cross-border access disputes.
2.
IXED AND MOBILE TERMINATION RATES  As of the withdrawal date, the EU's regulatory framework leading to low wholesale voice termination rates13 will no longer apply to EU service providers as regards calls between the EU and the United Kingdom. This may lead to increases in the wholesale termination rates for calls from the EU to the United Kingdom and ultimately to increased retail tariffs for such calls. 3.
OAMING As of the withdrawal date the United Kingdom becomes a third country for the purposes of EU rules on roaming (Regulation (EU) 531/2012).
Providers of roaming services to roaming customers (hereafter 'roaming providers') operating in the EU:  will no longer benefit, when requesting wholesale roaming access, from the obligation of mobile network operators operating in the United Kingdom to meet all reasonable requests for providing wholesale roaming access (Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 531/2012);   will no longer benefit from the EU rules on maximum wholesale roaming charges that visited network operators operating in the United Kingdom may charge for the provision of wholesale roaming services within the EU (Articles 7, 9, 12 of Regulation (EU) 531/2012). Roaming customers of roaming providers operating in the EU:  will no longer benefit from the retail obligation of their roaming provider not to levy any surcharge in addition to the domestic retail price on the
for the use in the United Kingdom of roaming services (calls made or received, SMS messages sent and data services), subject to fair use (Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 531/2012); but  will continue to benefit from the transparency obligations laid down in Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 531/2012 (voice and SMS) and Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 531/2012 (data services) when travelling to the United Kingdom. Roaming providers operating in the United Kingdom:                                                  13
Wholesale termination rates are the charges paid between operators to deliver the calls to their customers. Wholesale termination rates are addressed in a Commission Recommendation of 2009, which recommends a costing methodology for setting regulated termination rates (Commission Recommendation 2009/396/EC of 7 May 2009 on the Regulatory Treatment of Fixed and Mobile Termination Rates in the EU, OJ L 124, 20.5.2009, p. 67). Despite the non-binding nature of the Commission Recommendation of 2009
it is followed by most Member States and the Court of Justice has confirmed that a national competent authority may depart from a recommended approach only where it appears to the national competent authority, in its assessment of a given situation
that the recommended approach is not appropriate to the specific national circumstances and has to give a reasoned justification for its position. See the judgment in Case C28/15, paragraph 38
4  will no longer benefit, when requesting wholesale roaming access, from the obligation of mobile network operators operating in the EU to meet all reasonable requests for providing wholesale roaming access (Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 531/2012);   will no longer benefit from the EU rules on maximum wholesale roaming charges that visited network operators operating in the EU may charge for the provision of wholesale roaming services within the EU (Articles 7, 9, 12 of Regulation (EU) 531/2012).  Roaming customers of roaming providers operating in the United Kingdom:  will no longer benefit from the EU rules on the retail obligation of their roaming provider not to levy any surcharge in addition to the domestic retail price on the
for the use within the EU of roaming services (calls made or received, SMS messages sent and data services), subject to fair use (Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 531/2012); and  will no longer benefit from the EU rules on the transparency obligations laid down in Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 531/2012 (voice and SMS) and Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 531/2012 (data services) when travelling to the EU.
